Forecast the probability of the event by following this structured approach:

1. **Restate the event and benchmark** – clearly define what is being asked and the reference point against which it will be measured.
2. **Compute the historical base rate (reference class)** – gather the relevant past data, calculate the prior probability of the event occurring, and note any relevant thresholds.
3. **Identify key influencing factors** – list the main drivers that could shift the probability, rate their current influence (high/medium/low), and note any recent changes.
4. **Apply Bayesian updating** – combine the prior with the evidence from step 3 to produce a posterior probability.
5. **Present the final probability** – give a decimal between 0 and 1, a brief justification of the estimate, and any assumptions or sensitivity notes.

Make sure each step is explicitly shown and the reasoning is concise yet complete. You must always conclude with:

```
FINAL PROBABILITY: [decimal between 0 and 1]
