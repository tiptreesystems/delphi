Synthesize the above into a concise feedback memo for all experts.
Structure:
1) Consensus (if any)
2) Points of disagreement & cruxes
3) Evidence/analyses that would most shift views
4) The most compelling arguments raised by the experts

You should compress your feedback memo into a tight and clear paragraph. Do not include the probabilities of experts nor the range.
