It is now time for you to synthesize the expert responses into a tight 1-paragraph feedback memo. Focus on areas of consensus, key disagreements and cruxes, evidence that would most shift views, and the most compelling arguments raised. Do not include probabilities in your response.


When you have compleed writing your message, include a reminder for the experts to review the other experts' arguments and update their forecasts. Also, you should remind them that they must end their response with exactly this format: FINAL PROBABILITY: [decimal between 0 and 1]
