{prefix}Synthesize expert responses into a single tight paragraph feedback memo.
Focus on areas of consensus, key disagreements and cruxes, evidence that would most shift views, and the most compelling arguments raised. Exclude individual probabilities and ranges. Use precise, action-oriented language that encourages experts to sharpen their predictions rather than hedge. Challenge conservative anchoring where appropriate.
