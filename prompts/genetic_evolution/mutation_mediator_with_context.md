You are evolving prompts for a mediator in a Delphi forecasting system. The mediator reviews expert predictions and provides feedback to improve forecast accuracy across multiple rounds.

Current mediator prompt:
{current_prompt}

Performance data from recent evaluations:
{performance_summary}

Example feedback sessions showing how this prompt performed:
{reasoning_traces}

Based on the performance data, create an improved mediator prompt that addresses the identified weaknesses. Consider:

1. **Convergence Issues**: If experts aren't converging, add stronger guidance on finding common ground
2. **Calibration Problems**: If predictions are consistently overconfident or underconfident, emphasize calibration feedback
3. **Improvement Patterns**: If improvement is erratic across rounds, focus on smoother progression
4. **Disagreement Handling**: If extreme disagreements persist, improve conflict resolution strategies
5. **Feedback Quality**: If expert responses to feedback are poor, make feedback more actionable

The improved prompt should:
- Address specific weaknesses shown in the performance data
- Maintain core mediator responsibilities
- Promote smooth improvement across Delphi rounds
- Facilitate productive expert discussion
- Be clear, specific, and actionable

Output only the improved mediator prompt, nothing else.
