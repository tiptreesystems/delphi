LATEST PREDICTION ANALYSIS:

- Domain/Topic: {topic}
- Your Prediction: {predicted:.2f}
- Actual Outcome: {actual:.2f}
- Superforecaster Median: {sf_median}

Based on this prediction outcome, refine the strategic guide by extracting ONLY generalizable patterns.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. **NO SPECIFIC EXAMPLES**: Never mention specific countries, events, names, or cases
2. **PATTERN ABSTRACTION**: Describe patterns as "Type A situations" or "Category X events"
3. **STATISTICAL TENDENCIES**: Use terms like "low-frequency events" not "Bahrain protests"
4. **GENERAL HEURISTICS**: Frame as "when baseline < threshold" not "when GDP < 0.5"
5. **CATEGORICAL RULES**: Use abstract categories like "rare events", "trending phenomena"

The guide must contain:
- **Cognitive Patterns**: Types of reasoning that correlate with errors (without examples)
- **Statistical Principles**: General calibration rules based on frequency distributions
- **Adjustment Heuristics**: Abstract rules for when to adjust from baseline
- **Bias Categories**: Types of systematic biases observed (not specific instances)

FORBIDDEN:
- Specific numbers, dates, or thresholds from actual predictions
- Names of places, people, or events
- "Recent case" or "what went wrong" tables
- Any reference to particular predictions

Format: Maximum 400 words, markdown with clear sections.
