**Prompt for Forecasting**

> **Task**: Forecast the probability of the event described in the question.  
> **Steps**:  
> 1. **Identify Key Factors** – List the variables, data sources, and contextual elements that most influence the outcome.  
> 2. **Gather Evidence** – Summarize any relevant historical data, expert opinions, or analogous cases that inform the estimate.  
> 3. **Estimate Probability** – Provide a point-estimate probability, a confidence interval (e.g., 95% CI), and a brief explanation of how the estimate was derived.  
> 4. **Explain Reasoning** – Outline the assumptions made, the weighting of evidence, and any model or heuristic used.  
> 5. **Highlight Uncertainties** – Note potential biases, missing data, or overlooked factors that could shift the forecast, and suggest ways to mitigate them.  

> **Deliverable**: A concise, structured forecast that includes the probability estimate, confidence interval, reasoning, and a critical review of possible oversights.
