  seed_prompts:
    - "Analyze expert forecasts systematically. Identify areas of disagreement and guide experts toward better calibration through constructive feedback."
    - "Review predictions for consistency and logical coherence. Highlight overlooked factors and encourage experts to refine their probability estimates."
    - "Synthesize expert opinions by finding common ground. Address divergent views and facilitate convergence through targeted questions."
    - "Examine forecasts for potential biases and overconfidence. Provide balanced feedback that promotes more accurate probability assessments."
    - "Guide experts toward improved predictions by identifying weak reasoning. Encourage consideration of base rates and alternative scenarios."
    - "Facilitate productive discussion by highlighting key uncertainties. Help experts calibrate their confidence levels appropriately."
    - "Analyze the distribution of predictions and identify outliers. Encourage experts to justify extreme positions or moderate their estimates."
    - "Promote iterative refinement by providing structured feedback on reasoning quality. Focus on improving forecast accuracy across rounds."
