  "question": "Will the global surface air temperature on April 1, 2025 be greater than 14.7°C?",
  "probability": 0.75,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here are the key points relevant to estimating the probability that the global surface air temperature on April 1, 2025, will be greater than 14.7°C:\n\n1. **Historical Context**: April 2024 was the warmest April on record globally, with an average ERA5 surface air temperature of 15.03°C. This suggests a strong warming trend that could continue into 2025.\n\n2. **ENSO Conditions**: Currently, La Niña conditions are present, with a transition to ENSO-neutral conditions expected during March-May 2025. La Niña typically has a cooling effect on global temperatures, but the transition to neutral conditions might mitigate this effect.\n\n3. **Climate Change Impact**: The ongoing increase in greenhouse gases is expected to continue pushing global temperatures towards new records, as noted by experts from the Copernicus Climate Change Service.\n\n4. **Temperature Trends**: The global-average temperature for the past 12 months (May 2023 – April 2024) was the highest on record, indicating a persistent warming trend.\n\n5. **Forecasts and Predictions**: The forecasts indicate a 66% chance of transitioning to ENSO-neutral conditions during March-May 2025, which could lead to warmer conditions compared to a strong La Niña.\n\nConsidering these factors, the probability that the global surface air temperature on April 1, 2025, will be greater than 14.7°C is influenced by the strong warming trend observed in recent years, the expected transition to ENSO-neutral conditions, and the ongoing impact of climate change.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.75",

OISSTv2 is often used for real-time analysis and model initialization, while ERSSTv5 is used for retrospective official ENSO diagnosis because it is more homogeneous over time, allowing for more accurate comparisons among ENSO events that are years apart. These two products may differ, particularly during ENSO events. The difference between the two datasets may be as much as 0.5 °C. Additionally in some years, the ERSSTv5 may tend to be cooler than OISSTv2 in the context of warming trends, because ERSSTv5 is expressed relative to a base period that is updated every 5 years, while the base period of OISSTv2 is updated every 10 years. In February 2021, both datasets were updated to reflect the 1991-2020 climatology period.\n\n### Recent and Current Conditions\n\nThe SST anomaly in the NINO3.4 region during the Nov-Jan 2024 season was -0.50 °C, and for the month of January 2025 it was -0.71 °C. The most recent weekly average (week centered on 12 February 2025) of the NINO3.4 index was -0.3 °C. The latest seasonal and monthly values suggest that the tropical Pacific has been experiencing weak La Niña conditions. The IRI’s definition of El Niño, like NOAA/Climate Prediction Center’s, requires that the monthly SST anomaly in the NINO3.4 region (5S-5N; 170W-120W) exceed +0.5 °C. Similarly, for La Niña, the anomaly must be -0.5 °C or colder.\n\nBoth atmospheric and oceanic conditions across the tropical Pacific now exhibit characteristics indicative of La Niña. For instance, while the traditional Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) for January 2025 was +0.8, placing it within the ENSO-neutral range, the equatorial SOI for the same month was +1.8, falling within the La Niña range. The trade winds (at 850 hPa) were stronger than normal during January 2025, and, as of mid-February 2025, they continue to be above average, while the upper-level winds (at 200 hPa) are close to average over the equatorial Pacific. Atmospheric convection over the central Pacific is strongly below normal, while above normal cloudiness is observed over Indonesia. Below-average ocean temperatures persist at d…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 386 words out of ~1341. Full content available via `btf_extract_evidence`.]"

OISSTv2 is often used for real-time analysis and model initialization, while ERSSTv5 is used for retrospective official ENSO diagnosis because it is more homogeneous over time, allowing for more accurate comparisons among ENSO events that are years apart. These two products may differ, particularly during ENSO events. The difference between the two datasets may be as much as 0.5 °C. Additionally in some years, the ERSSTv5 may tend to be cooler than OISSTv2 in the context of warming trends, because ERSSTv5 is expressed relative to a base period that is updated every 5 years, while the base period of OISSTv2 is updated every 10 years.

The most recent weekly average (week centered on 12 February 2025) of the NINO3.4 index was -0.3 °C. The latest seasonal and monthly values suggest that the tropical Pacific has been experiencing weak La Niña conditions. The IRI’s definition of El Niño, like NOAA/Climate Prediction Center’s, requires that the monthly SST anomaly in the NINO3.4 region (5S-5N; 170W-120W) exceed +0.5 °C. Similarly, for La Niña, the anomaly must be -0.5 °C or colder.\n\nBoth atmospheric and oceanic conditions across the tropical Pacific now exhibit characteristics indicative of La Niña. For instance, while the traditional Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) for January 2025 was +0.8, placing it within the ENSO-neutral range, the equatorial SOI for the same month was +1.8, falling within the La Niña range. The trade winds (at 850 hPa) were stronger than normal during January 2025, and, as of mid-February 2025, they continue to be above average, while the upper-level winds (at 200 hPa) are close to average over the equatorial Pacific. Atmospheric convection over the central Pacific is strongly below normal, while above normal cloudiness is observed over Indonesia.

OISSTv2 is often used for real-time analysis and model initialization, while ERSSTv5 is used for retrospective official ENSO diagnosis because it is more homogeneous over time, allowing for more accurate comparisons among ENSO events that are years apart. These two products may differ, particularly during ENSO events. The difference between the two datasets may be as much as 0.5 \\u00b0C. Additionally in some years, the ERSSTv5 may tend to be cooler than OISSTv2 in the context of warming trends, because ERSSTv5 is expressed relative to a base period that is updated every 5 years, while the base period of OISSTv2 is updated every 10 years. In February 2021, both datasets were updated to reflect the 1991-2020 climatology period.\\n\\n### Recent and Current Conditions\\n\\nThe SST anomaly in the NINO3.4 region during the Nov-Jan 2024 season was -0.50 \\u00b0C, and for the month of January 2025 it was -0.71 \\u00b0C. The most recent weekly average (week centered on 12 February 2025) of the NINO3.4 index was -0.3 \\u00b0C. The latest seasonal and monthly values suggest that the tropical Pacific has been experiencing weak La Ni\\u00f1a conditions. The IRI\\u2019s definition of El Ni\\u00f1o, like NOAA/Climate Prediction Center\\u2019s, requires that the monthly SST anomaly in the NINO3.4 region (5S-5N; 170W-120W) exceed +0.5 \\u00b0C. Similarly, for La Ni\\u00f1a, the anomaly must be -0.5 \\u00b0C or colder.\\n\\nBoth atmospheric and oceanic conditions across the tropical Pacific now exhibit characteristics indicative of La Ni\\u00f1a. For instance, while the traditional Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) for January 2025 was +0.8, placing it within the ENSO-neutral range, the equatorial SOI for the same month was +1.8, falling within the La Ni\\u00f1a range. The trade winds (at 850 hPa) were stronger than normal during January 2025, and, as of mid-February 2025, they continue to be above average, while the upper-level winds (at 200 hPa) are close to average over the equatorial Pacific. Atmospheric convection over the central Pacific is strongly below normal, while above normal cloudiness is observed over Indonesia. Below-average ocean temperatures persist at d\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 386 words out of ~1341.

      "content": "Based on the gathered evidence, here are the key points relevant to estimating the probability that the global surface air temperature on April 1, 2025, will be greater than 14.7°C:\n\n1. **Historical Context**: April 2024 was the warmest April on record globally, with an average ERA5 surface air temperature of 15.03°C. This suggests a strong warming trend that could continue into 2025.\n\n2. **ENSO Conditions**: Currently, La Niña conditions are present, with a transition to ENSO-neutral conditions expected during March-May 2025. La Niña typically has a cooling effect on global temperatures, but the transition to neutral conditions might mitigate this effect.\n\n3. **Climate Change Impact**: The ongoing increase in greenhouse gases is expected to continue pushing global temperatures towards new records, as noted by experts from the Copernicus Climate Change Service.\n\n4. **Temperature Trends**: The global-average temperature for the past 12 months (May 2023 – April 2024) was the highest on record, indicating a persistent warming trend.\n\n5. **Forecasts and Predictions**: The forecasts indicate a 66% chance of transitioning to ENSO-neutral conditions during March-May 2025, which could lead to warmer conditions compared to a strong La Niña.\n\nConsidering these factors, the probability that the global surface air temperature on April 1, 2025, will be greater than 14.7°C is influenced by the strong warming trend observed in recent years, the expected transition to ENSO-neutral conditions, and the ongoing impact of climate change.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.75"
