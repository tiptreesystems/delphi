  "question": "Will the Great Lakes ice coverage be less than 15.0% on March 30, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.75,
  "reasoning": "Based on the information gathered from recent reports on Great Lakes ice coverage:\n\n1. As of March 15, 2025, the consolidated ice coverage for the Great Lakes was reported to be 15.63%. This is slightly above the 15% threshold required for a \"YES\" resolution to the question.\n\n2. A report from March 18, 2025, indicates that the average ice cover across the Great Lakes was approximately 13.5%. This suggests a decreasing trend in ice coverage as the season progresses.\n\n3. The winter of 2024-2025 has been relatively normal compared to recent years, with ice cover peaking in February at just over 50% due to a polar vortex. However, the ice coverage has been decreasing since then.\n\nGiven the current trend of decreasing ice coverage and the fact that the average ice cover was already below 15% as of March 18, it is likely that the ice coverage will continue to decrease and remain below 15% by March 30, 2025.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.75",

Here’s a look at how the ice cover measured up this winter.\n\nAll of the Great Lakes with the exception of Lake Superior had a peak ice day that eclipsed the long-term peak ice amount.\n\nThe ice cover percentage peaked on February 20 for Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. The ice peaked on February 21 for Lakes Superior, Michigan and Huron.\n\nLake Superior peaked at 46 percent covered with ice on February 21. The long-term average peak ice on Superior is 50 percent.\n\nLake Michigan peaked at 33 percent covered with ice on February 21. The long-term average peak ice on Lake Michigan is 24 percent.\n\nLake Huron’s ice cover expanded to 71 percent on February 21. This is 20 percent higher than the long-term average peak ice at 51 percent.\n\nLake Erie typically has a lot of ice due to the shallow nature of the lake. This year Lake Erie came within 4.2 percent of being deemed totally frozen over.\n\nLake Ontario usually has the least ice of any Great Lake. This year Ontario peaked at 26 percent covered with ice, compared to a long-term peak of 18 percent.\n\nWith the [very warm weather coming late this week](https://www.mlive.com/weather/2025/03/michigans-weather-this-week-suddenly-where-did-winter-go-70-degrees-possible.html) and a warmer-than-normal extended forecast we won’t have ice much longer on the Great Lakes.\n\n## Stories by [Mark Torregrossa](https://www.mlive.com/staff/torregrossa/posts.html)"

How will this season compare?\n\n- The 2024-2025 Great Lakes ice season has seen near-normal ice cover, a change from recent years with record lows.\n- Ice cover peaked in February at just over 50% due to a polar vortex.\n- Climate change continues to cause a long-term decline in Great Lakes ice, impacting the ecosystem and surrounding communities.\n\nThis Great Lakes ice season has proven to be much better than the past few years — in fact, it's been relatively normal.\n\nSo far, the 2024-'25 ice season has measured up to the [slightly below to near normal conditions predicted](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/2024/12/23/this-years-cold-december-impacts-2024-25-great-lakes-ice-forecast/76961912007/) by the U.S. National Ice Center in December, a reprieve from the record-breaking previous year. During the 2023-2024 ice season, average ice cover across all five lakes was only 4.3% — the lowest on record since scientists began recording ice cover more than 50 years ago, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The 2022-2023 season was [the fourth lowest](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2023/05/26/great-lakes-average-ice-cover-fourth-lowest-in-more-than-50-years/70075822007/) on record at about 6.2%.\n\nSo far this winter season, maximum ice cover peaked [at about 52%](https://apps.glerl.noaa.gov/coastwatch/webdata/statistic/ice/dat/g2024_2025_ice.dat) across the Great Lakes after February's polar vortex brought gripping cold to the region. That number is about the same as the long-term average peak.\n\nAs of March 16, average ice cover across the lakes was [roughly 13.5%](https://apps.glerl.noaa.gov/coastwatch/webdata/statistic/ice/dat/g2024_2025_ice.dat). And the season is far from over, as ice-off, which marks the end to the ice season, typically happens in April or early May.\n\nHere's what to know about the ice season so far.\n\n## Ice cover across the Great Lakes peaked in mid-February\n\nThe U.…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 336 words out of ~1033.

During the 2023-2024 ice season, average ice cover across all five lakes was only 4.3% — the lowest on record since scientists began recording ice cover more than 50 years ago, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The 2022-2023 season was [the fourth lowest](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2023/05/26/great-lakes-average-ice-cover-fourth-lowest-in-more-than-50-years/70075822007/) on record at about 6.2%.\n\nSo far this winter season, maximum ice cover peaked [at about 52%](https://apps.glerl.noaa.gov/coastwatch/webdata/statistic/ice/dat/g2024_2025_ice.dat) across the Great Lakes after February's polar vortex brought gripping cold to the region. That number is about the same as the long-term average peak.\n\nAs of March 16, average ice cover across the lakes was [roughly 13.5%](https://apps.glerl.noaa.gov/coastwatch/webdata/statistic/ice/dat/g2024_2025_ice.dat). And the season is far from over, as ice-off, which marks the end to the ice season, typically happens in April or early May.\n\nHere's what to know about the ice season so far.\n\n## Ice cover across the Great Lakes peaked in mid-February\n\nThe U.…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 336 words out of ~1033.

      "content": "Based on the information gathered from recent reports on Great Lakes ice coverage:\n\n1. As of March 15, 2025, the consolidated ice coverage for the Great Lakes was reported to be 15.63%. This is slightly above the 15% threshold required for a \"YES\" resolution to the question.\n\n2. A report from March 18, 2025, indicates that the average ice cover across the Great Lakes was approximately 13.5%. This suggests a decreasing trend in ice coverage as the season progresses.\n\n3. The winter of 2024-2025 has been relatively normal compared to recent years, with ice cover peaking in February at just over 50% due to a polar vortex. However, the ice coverage has been decreasing since then.\n\nGiven the current trend of decreasing ice coverage and the fact that the average ice cover was already below 15% as of March 18, it is likely that the ice coverage will continue to decrease and remain below 15% by March 30, 2025.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.75"
