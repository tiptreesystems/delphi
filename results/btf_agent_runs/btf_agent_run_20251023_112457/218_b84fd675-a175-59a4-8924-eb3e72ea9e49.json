  "question": "Will the DOGE Live Tracker report Savings Per Taxpayer $750.00 or more on March 31, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.2,
  "reasoning": "Based on the information gathered, here are the key points relevant to the question of whether the DOGE Live Tracker will report Savings Per Taxpayer of $750.00 or more on March 31, 2025:\n\n1. **Current Savings Status**: The DOGE Live Tracker reports that 5.75% of a $2 trillion savings goal has been achieved. This indicates progress but does not provide a specific savings per taxpayer figure.\n\n2. **Doubts on Accuracy**: Multiple sources, including Fortune and NPR, have expressed skepticism about the accuracy of DOGE's reported savings figures. Experts have noted that the savings claims are often inflated and include inaccuracies.\n\n3. **Savings Claims**: As of early March 2025, DOGE claimed savings of $105 billion. However, the goal is to save $1 trillion by the end of the fiscal year, which requires saving $4 billion per day.\n\n4. **Impact of Measures**: The cost-cutting measures, such as contract cancellations and workforce reductions, target a small portion of the federal budget, limiting their overall impact.\n\n5. **Prediction Markets**: Current prediction markets suggest a low probability of a significant DOGE dividend being issued, which may affect the overall savings per taxpayer.\n\nGiven these factors, the likelihood of the DOGE Live Tracker reporting Savings Per Taxpayer of $750.00 or more by the specified date seems low. The skepticism about the accuracy of savings figures and the ambitious nature of the savings goals contribute to this assessment.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.2",

But it's not looking at big spending drivers\n\nElon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency have an ambitious goal of cutting $1 trillion in federal spending by the end of the fiscal year in September.\n\nBut DOGE's moves so far to cancel contracts, end leases and push federal agencies to reduce their workforces barely make a dent in the government's overall balance sheet — even if you take DOGE's savings claims at face value.\n\nAnd as [NPR has reported](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/01/nx-s1-5313853/doge-savings-receipts-musk-trump), those early DOGE savings claims have been inaccurate and drastically overstated.\n\nIn Congress, where decisions about trillions of dollars in spending are debated and authorized in appropriations bills, House Republicans have [approved a framework](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/25/nx-s1-5308067/house-republicans-budget-vote-mike-johnson) that would include $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and a goal of $2 trillion in spending cuts. There are several more steps until legislation like that could get final approval.\n\nIt's through congressional action, not DOGE, where any changes to spending and revenue collection would happen at a meaningful scale, said Jessica Riedl of the center-right Manhattan Institute.\n\n\"Think of Congress and its budget as the debt-ridden dad on the way to buy a $250,000 Ferrari on the credit card, and DOGE is the $2-off gas card he used along the way,\" Riedl said. \"It's great that he saved $2 on gas, but I think his wife may be more concerned about the $250,000 car.\"\n\n### DOGE's alleged savings are a drop in the budget bucket\n\nFor every dollar that the federal government has spent so far since the start of this fiscal year in October 2024, DOGE — which began operating in mid-January — has claimed to save the equivalent of about four pennies.\n\nFrom Oct. 1, 2024, through Jan. 31, 2025, the federal government collected [$1.6 trillion](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/governmen…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 366 words out of ~905.

      "content": "Based on the information gathered, here are the key points relevant to the question of whether the DOGE Live Tracker will report Savings Per Taxpayer of $750.00 or more on March 31, 2025:\n\n1. **Current Savings Status**: The DOGE Live Tracker reports that 5.75% of a $2 trillion savings goal has been achieved. This indicates progress but does not provide a specific savings per taxpayer figure.\n\n2. **Doubts on Accuracy**: Multiple sources, including Fortune and NPR, have expressed skepticism about the accuracy of DOGE's reported savings figures. Experts have noted that the savings claims are often inflated and include inaccuracies.\n\n3. **Savings Claims**: As of early March 2025, DOGE claimed savings of $105 billion. However, the goal is to save $1 trillion by the end of the fiscal year, which requires saving $4 billion per day.\n\n4. **Impact of Measures**: The cost-cutting measures, such as contract cancellations and workforce reductions, target a small portion of the federal budget, limiting their overall impact.\n\n5. **Prediction Markets**: Current prediction markets suggest a low probability of a significant DOGE dividend being issued, which may affect the overall savings per taxpayer.\n\nGiven these factors, the likelihood of the DOGE Live Tracker reporting Savings Per Taxpayer of $750.00 or more by the specified date seems low. The skepticism about the accuracy of savings figures and the ambitious nature of the savings goals contribute to this assessment.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.2"
