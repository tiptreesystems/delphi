This shift aims to simplify product offerings and enhance user experience, with tiered subscription levels for varying intelligence. As competition heats up, the success of GPT-5 will be pivotal for OpenAI’s future.\nsitename: InfoQ\ndate: 2025-02-18\ntags: ['openai new gpts,Development,AI, ML & Data Engineering,OpenAI,Software Development,Artificial Intelligence,']\n---\nEarlier in the week, [OpenAI](http://openai.com) announced it is restructuring its AI roadmap, consolidating its efforts around GPT-5 while scrapping the previously planned o3 standalone release.\n\nInitially, OpenAI had intended to roll out GPT-4.5 (code-named Orion) as an intermediary update, but internal reports suggested that its improvements over GPT-4 were marginal. Instead, CEO [Sam Altman](https://x.com/sama) confirmed that OpenAI will deliver a “unified intelligence” model with GPT-5, eliminating the need for users to select different versions within ChatGPT.\n\nAltman has said GPT-5 will be designed to integrate multiple capabilities—reasoning, voice synthesis, search, and deep research—into a single model. OpenAI aims to streamline its product lineup by removing the current model picker and letting the AI dynamically determine how much computational power is needed for a given task. This move follows OpenAI’s increasing focus on reasoning models, which self-verify outputs for greater reliability at the cost of additional inference time. While OpenAI pioneered this approach with o1, competitors like DeepSeek have quickly closed the gap, prompting OpenAI to accelerate its release schedule to maintain its lead.\n\n\"We want to do a better job of sharing our intended roadmap, and a much better job simplifying our product offerings... We want AI to just work for you; we realize how complicated our model and product offerings have gotten.\" -\n\n[Sam Altman]\n\nAltman outlined OpenAI’s planned subscription tiers for GPT-5, where free users will have access to a standard intelligence level, while ChatGPT Plus and Pro subscribers will receive progressively more advanced reasoning capabilities. This marks a shift in OpenAI’s monetization strategy, movi…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 349 words out of ~629. Full content available via `btf_extract_evidence`.]"

Described as a successor to o1 and skipping over o2, purportedly due to [<u>Telefonica’s O2</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O2_\\(UK\\)), OpenAI [<u>described</u>](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-announces-o3-models-175657596.html) o3 as a significant breakthrough in AI reasoning. The model was reported to have significantly outperformed any previous AI system [<u>on coding and research-level math</u>](https://x.com/polynoamial/status/1870172996650053653?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1870172996650053653%7Ctwgr%5E16fa4771724238be9b30de71968a334c68bca7af%7Ctwcon%5Es1_\\&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2024%2F12%2F20%2Fopenai-announces-new-o3-model%2F), and also [<u>exceeded previous performance</u>](https://arcprize.org/blog/oai-o3-pub-breakthrough) on the [<u>Abstract and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence</u>](https://arcprize.org/arc) (ARC-AGI) challenge by far, even reaching approximately human level. According to ARC-AGI:\n\n> Despite the significant cost per task, these numbers aren't just the result of applying brute force compute to the benchmark. OpenAI's new o3 model represents a significant leap forward in AI's ability to adapt to novel tasks. This is not merely incremental improvement, but a genuine breakthrough, marking a qualitative shift in AI capabilities compared to the prior limitations of LLMs. o3 is a system capable of adapting to tasks it has never encountered before, arguably approaching human-level performance in the ARC-AGI domain.\n>\n> Of course, such generality comes at a steep cost, and wouldn't quite be economical yet: you could pay a human to solve ARC-AGI tasks for roughly \\$5 per task (we know, we did that), while consuming mere cents in energy. Meanwhile o3 requires \\$17-20 per task in the low-compute mode. But cost-performance will likely improve quite dramatically over the next few months and years, so you should plan for these capabilities to become competitive with human work within a fairly short timeline.\n\nOpenAI also announced applicants could [<u>apply</u>](https://openai.com/index/early-access-for-safety-testing/) to help safety test forthcoming advanced models. In the announcement video, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman [<u>said</u>](https://www.youtube.com/live/SKBG1sqdyIU?si=_93eeXULrkrt8K_o\\&t=1293):\n\n> We plan to launch o3-mini around the end of January, and full o3 shortly after that, but . . . the more people can help us safety test the more we can make sure we hit that.\nResolution criteria: This question will resolve as **Yes** if, before March 28, 2025, Eastern Time, OpenAI has made the full version of its announced o3 model publicly available via web interface.\nFine print: * An o3 version will be considered to be the “full” version if it does not have any qualifiers in its name or description that suggest that the version is not the full version.\n* For example “o3-mini” would not count, and neither would a model named “o3-preview” or described in the announcement or model description as a preview or otherwise not yet the full o3. Stated intentions to continue developing and improving the o3 model will **not** on their own result in the model being considered to not yet be the full version of o3.\n* Names or descriptions that suggest a variant form of a “full” version will be sufficient to resolve the question as **Yes**. For example, o3-pro would be sufficient, while different versions with low and high compute times would also count, for example “o3-low” or “o3-high”, so long as Metaculus assesses that their descriptions are compatible with being a variant of o3 full.\n* It is immaterial if o3 is released with limited or restricted reasoning or compute times. For example, if o3 is released in a manner that satisfies these criteria but is only available in “low” compute mode or has similar restrictions, the question will still resolve as **Yes**.\n* In the event OpenAI renames o3 to be something other than o3, this question will still resolve as **Yes** if OpenAI states that the model is the one formerly announced as o3 and all other criteria have been met.\n* Metaculus will defer to statements made by OpenAI. For example, it will be immaterial if there is speculation that a released o3 model does not have the full capabilities described in previous announcements of o3.\n* Releases of other models are immaterial. For example if GPT-5 is released and it is not publicly described by OpenAI as being o3, that will not be sufficient.\n* The model will be considered publicly available via web interface if it is available on a webpage for users to interact and converse with, including if limited only to paid subscribers of a certain payment tier, and all of the following availability criteria also apply:\n* It must be available to users in the United States.

Described as a successor to o1 and skipping over o2, purportedly due to Telefonica’s O2, OpenAI described o3 as a significant breakthrough in AI reasoning. The model was reported to have significantly outperformed any previous AI system on coding and research-level math, and also exceeded previous performance on the Abstract and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) challenge by far, even reaching approximately human level.\",\"resolution_criteria\":\"This question will resolve as Yes if, before March 28, 2025, Eastern Time, OpenAI has made the full version of its announced o3 model publicly available via web interface.\",\"fine_print\":\"An o3 version will be considered to be the “full” version if it does not have any qualifiers in its name or description that suggest that the version is not the full version. For example “o3-mini” would not count, and neither would a model named “o3-preview” or described in the announcement or model description as a preview or otherwise not yet the full o3. Stated intentions to continue developing and improving the o3 model will not on their own result in the model being considered to not yet be the full version of o3. Names or descriptions that suggest a variant form of a “full” version will be sufficient to resolve the question as Yes. For example, o3-pro would be sufficient, while different versions with low and high compute times would also count, for example “o3-low” or “o3-high”, so long as Metaculus assesses that their descriptions are compatible with being a variant of o3 full. It is immaterial if o3 is released with limited or restricted reasoning or compute times. For example, if o3 is released in a manner that satisfies these criteria but is only available in “low” compute mode or has similar restrictions, the question will still resolve as Yes. In the event OpenAI renames o3 to be something other than o3, this question will still resolve as Yes if OpenAI states that the model is the one formerly announced as o3 and all other criteria have been met. Metaculus will defer to statements made by OpenAI. For example, it will be immaterial if there is speculation that a released o3 model does not have the full capabilities described in previous announcements of o3. Releases of other models are immaterial. For example if GPT-5 is released and it is not publicly described by OpenAI as being o3, that will not be sufficient. The model will be considered publicly available via web interface if it is available on a webpage for users to interact and converse with, including if limited only to paid subscribers of a certain payment tier, and all of the following availability criteria also apply: It must be available to users in the United States. Availability in other countries is not required. It must not be subject to an invite-only waitlist, for example invite-only betas or testing periods are not sufficient. In the event of a gradual or phased rollout, or in the event access and signups are disabled due to high demand, the question will resolve as Yes if at least two Metaculus admins are able to access o3, on separate accounts, as described in these criteria before the date in question. Metaculus admins will not make excessive effort to check for access or to try to get access (aside from completing any signup or subscription steps needed to access o3), and will simply check periodically whether they can access o3. Rate limits or usage restrictions on the number of messages allowed are immaterial, so long as at least one message and response can be had. Release of o3 via API without being released as a web interface is not sufficient.\",\"present_date\":\"2025-03-02T18:51:00.111622\",\"date_cutoff_start\":null,\"date_cutoff_end\":null,\"scoring_weight\":1.0,\"resolution\":\"unknown\",\"resolved_at\":null,\"max_facts\":5}"
