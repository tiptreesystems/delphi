  "question": "Will Eric Adams be Mayor of New York City on the 1st of April 2025?",
  "probability": 0.85,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here are the key points regarding Eric Adams' status as Mayor of New York City:\n\n1. **Corruption Charges**: Eric Adams was indicted on federal corruption charges in late September 2024. However, there is a significant legal and political maneuvering around these charges. The Justice Department, under the Trump administration, moved to drop the charges, which has led to a crisis and resignations within the department. There are allegations of a quid pro quo between the Justice Department and Adams.\n\n2. **Political Instability**: There have been calls for Eric Adams to resign, notably from the Speaker of the New York City Council, Adrienne Adams, following the resignation of four deputy mayors. The situation is described as causing instability and threatening chaos in New York City.\n\n3. **Current Status**: Despite the scandals and calls for resignation, there is no credible report or official announcement of Eric Adams having resigned or been removed from office as of March 25, 2025. The articles reviewed do not mention any resignation or removal, and legal proceedings regarding the corruption charges are ongoing.\n\n4. **Federal Relations**: Eric Adams has been managing the city's relationship with the federal government carefully, especially concerning the Trump administration, to avoid potential withholding of federal funding.\n\nGiven the absence of any official announcement or credible report of his resignation or removal, and considering the resolution criteria, it is reasonable to estimate a high probability that Eric Adams will still be the Mayor of New York City on April 1, 2025.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.85",

Instead, his scandal-ridden mayoralty became a symbol — and engine — of the city’s chaos.\n\nSupported by\n\n[SKIP ADVERTISEMENT](https://www.nytimes.com#after-sponsor)\n\nMayor Eric Adams was milling around a Manhattan ballroom, tuxedoed and small-talking, on a Thursday night a few weeks before the 2024 election. Donald J. Trump made the first move.\n\nSince Adams’s indictment in late September on federal corruption charges, those close to him told us, he had felt abandoned and isolated, a mayor unmoored. Here was a relative stranger, the once and future president, edging his way at a white-tie charity dinner. “He actually put his arm around him,” David Paterson, a former New York governor and a fellow attendee, told us. Adams looked touched. He said little the rest of the night. “He was kind of quiet, almost like he’s thinking about it,” Paterson, a longtime friend, said. “Like: ‘Is this possible? Boy.’”\n\nOnce they reached the dais, Paterson recalled, Trump had a parting message for Adams: “Hang in there.” At the microphone moments later, before an audience of city dignitaries who largely disdained them both, Trump turned the subtext to text: A connection had been made. “We were persecuted, Eric,” he told the crowd at the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner, a $5,000-a-plate annual benefit for Catholic charities that historically hosts presidential candidates. “I was persecuted, and so are you, Eric.”\n\nThe chance encounter set in motion what would become the signal political emergency in New York’s modern history, perpetrated by two sons of Queens with a shared instinct for brazen survival and naked transaction.\n\nBut, really, what could surprise the city by now? Elected to deliver New York from disorder and disrepair, Adams established himself as the avatar of its chaos well before his arrest — a proper…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 381 words out of ~397.

But judges do have a role in approving *how* a case is dismissed once the department has decided to abandon it. In the Adams case, the “proper remedy” is a permanent dismissal, Clement told U.S. District Judge Dale Ho.\n\nAllowing the department to retain the right to revive the charges could create an appearance of improper leverage over the mayor, Clement suggested. Or, he acknowledged, it could create an actual shakedown, in which the administration could use the threat of the charges to pressure the mayor to assist with President Donald Trump’s agenda.\n\nHo appointed Clement last month [to present “adversarial” arguments](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/21/eric-adams-corruption-charges-paul-clement-00205473) on the department’s bid to abandon the charges against Adams.

The spreadsheet has columns listing the agency, the federal issue in question, proposed language and whether it has been approved.\n\nThe mayor’s office has avoided making public statements about “Know Your Rights” guidance on how immigrants should respond to federal immigration officials and gender-affirming health care for transgender people, according to one of the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.\n\nThe tracker is consistent with Mr. Adams’s stance since Mr. Trump took office.

But judges do have a role in approving *how* a case is dismissed once the department has decided to abandon it. In the Adams case, the “proper remedy” is a permanent dismissal, Clement told U.S. District Judge Dale Ho.\n\nAllowing the department to retain the right to revive the charges could create an appearance of improper leverage over the mayor, Clement suggested. Or, he acknowledged, it could create an actual shakedown, in which the administration could use the threat of the charges to pressure the mayor to assist with President Donald Trump’s agenda.\n\nHo appointed Clement last month [to present “adversarial” arguments](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/21/eric-adams-corruption-charges-paul-clement-00205473) on the department’s bid to abandon the charges against Adams. Ho does not have to follow Clement’s recommendation.\n\nThe extraordinary effort by top Trump administration officials to [stop prosecuting Adams](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/10/trumps-justice-department-moves-to-drop-charges-against-eric…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 335 words out of ~909.

But judges do have a role in approving *how* a case is dismissed once the department has decided to abandon it. In the Adams case, the \\u201cproper remedy\\u201d is a permanent dismissal, Clement told U.S. District Judge Dale Ho.\\n\\nAllowing the department to retain the right to revive the charges could create an appearance of improper leverage over the mayor, Clement suggested. Or, he acknowledged, it could create an actual shakedown, in which the administration could use the threat of the charges to pressure the mayor to assist with President Donald Trump\\u2019s agenda.\\n\\nHo appointed Clement last month [to present \\u201cadversarial\\u201d arguments](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/21/eric-adams-corruption-charges-paul-clement-00205473) on the department\\u2019s bid to abandon the charges against Adams.

But judges do have a role in approving *how* a case is dismissed once the department has decided to abandon it. In the Adams case, the \\u201cproper remedy\\u201d is a permanent dismissal, Clement told U.S. District Judge Dale Ho.\\n\\nAllowing the department to retain the right to revive the charges could create an appearance of improper leverage over the mayor, Clement suggested.

      "content": "Based on the gathered evidence, here are the key points regarding Eric Adams' status as Mayor of New York City:\n\n1. **Corruption Charges**: Eric Adams was indicted on federal corruption charges in late September 2024. However, there is a significant legal and political maneuvering around these charges. The Justice Department, under the Trump administration, moved to drop the charges, which has led to a crisis and resignations within the department. There are allegations of a quid pro quo between the Justice Department and Adams.\n\n2. **Political Instability**: There have been calls for Eric Adams to resign, notably from the Speaker of the New York City Council, Adrienne Adams, following the resignation of four deputy mayors. The situation is described as causing instability and threatening chaos in New York City.\n\n3. **Current Status**: Despite the scandals and calls for resignation, there is no credible report or official announcement of Eric Adams having resigned or been removed from office as of March 25, 2025. The articles reviewed do not mention any resignation or removal, and legal proceedings regarding the corruption charges are ongoing.\n\n4. **Federal Relations**: Eric Adams has been managing the city's relationship with the federal government carefully, especially concerning the Trump administration, to avoid potential withholding of federal funding.\n\nGiven the absence of any official announcement or credible report of his resignation or removal, and considering the resolution criteria, it is reasonable to estimate a high probability that Eric Adams will still be the Mayor of New York City on April 1, 2025.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.85"
