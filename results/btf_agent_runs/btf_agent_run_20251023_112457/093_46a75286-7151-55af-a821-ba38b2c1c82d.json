  "question": "Will \"Big Boys\" win the 2025 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Film -- Limited Release?",
  "probability": 0.2,
  "reasoning": "Based on the information gathered:\n\n1. **Nomination**: \"Big Boys\" is nominated for the Outstanding Film – Limited Release category at the 36th GLAAD Media Awards. This nomination indicates that the film meets the criteria set by GLAAD, which includes fair, accurate, and inclusive representations of the LGBTQ community, as well as boldness, originality, cultural impact, and overall quality.\n\n2. **Competition**: The film is competing against other nominees such as \"20,000 Species of Bees,\" \"Backspot,\" \"Before I Change My Mind,\" \"Close to You,\" \"Crossing,\" \"Fitting In,\" \"High Tide,\" \"Housekeeping for Beginners,\" and \"A Place of Our Own.\" The presence of strong competitors can influence the probability of winning.\n\n3. **Film Characteristics**: \"Big Boys\" is a comedy-drama with LGBTQ+ themes, directed and written by Corey Sherman. It was released as a limited release, making it eligible for this category. The film's originality and quality, as well as its representation of LGBTQ+ themes, are likely factors in its nomination.\n\n4. **Cultural Impact and Quality**: The film's distribution by Dark Star Pictures, known for independent films, suggests a potential for cultural impact within niche audiences. The film's reception and reviews, which were not fully detailed here, would further inform its chances.\n\nGiven these factors, the probability of \"Big Boys\" winning the award depends on how it is perceived in terms of its representation, originality, cultural impact, and overall quality compared to its competitors. Without specific reviews or insights into how it stands out among the nominees, estimating the probability involves some uncertainty.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.2",

More on that below.\n\nVying for the Outstanding Wide-Release Film prize are *Cuckoo, Drive-Away Dolls, Love Lies Bleeding, Mean Girls, My Old Ass, Problemista, Queer *and *Wicked*. Up for the Limited-Release Film award are *20,000 Species of Bees, Backspot, Before I Change My Mind, Big Boys, Close to You, Crossing, Fitting In, High Tide, Housekeeping for Beginners *and *A Place of Our Own*.\n\nNoticeably absent from the GLAAD noms is Jacques Audiard’s Oscar contender * Emilia Pérez*, which\n\n[won the Golden Globe](https://deadline.com/2025/01/golden-globes-2025-winners-list-1236246217/)this month, and its trans star Karla Sofía Gascón, who also won a Globe and is up\n\n[for SAG](https://deadline.com/2025/01/sag-awards-nominations-2025-1236249911/)and\n\n[BAFTA awards](https://deadline.com/2025/01/bafta-nominations-conclave-emilia-perez-wicked-hugh-grant-1236257429/)in February. Back in November, GLAAD put out an article titled\n\n[“‘Emilia Pérez’ is Not Good Trans Representation,”](https://glaad.org/emilia-perez-is-not-good-trans-representation/)labeling the film — among other things — a “profoundly retrograde portrayal of a trans woman” and calling it “a step backward.”\n\n### Watch on Deadline\n\nDespite the snub for its *Emilia Pérez*, Netflix still dominated the GLAAD noms with 27 to lead all networks and platforms. ABC was the only other to muster double digits, with 10. Prime Video got nine, and Hulu and CBS took eight apiece.\n\nHere are the nominees for the 2025 [GLAAD Media Awards](https://deadline.com/tag/glaad-media-awards/):\n\n**Outstanding Film – Wide Theatrical Release**Cuckoo (Neon)\n\nDrive-Away Dolls (Focus Features)\n\nLove Lies Bleeding (A24)\n\nMean Girls (Paramou…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 317 words out of ~3020.

More on that below.\\n\\nVying for the Outstanding Wide-Release Film prize are Cuckoo, Drive-Away Dolls, Love Lies Bleeding, Mean Girls, My Old Ass, Problemista, Queer and Wicked. Up for the Limited-Release Film award are 20,000 Species of Bees, Backspot, Before I Change My Mind, Big Boys, Close to You, Crossing, Fitting In, High Tide, Housekeeping for Beginners and A Place of Our Own.\\n\\nNoticeably absent from the GLAAD noms is Jacques Audiard’s Oscar contender Emilia Pérez, which won the Golden Globe this month, and its trans star Karla Sofía Gascón, who also won a Globe and is up for SAG and BAFTA awards in February. Back in November, GLAAD put out an article titled “Emilia Pérez is Not Good Trans Representation,” labeling the film — among other things — a “profoundly retrograde portrayal of a trans woman” and calling it “a step backward.”\\n\\nDespite the snub for its Emilia Pérez, Netflix still dominated the GLAAD noms with 27 to lead all networks and platforms. ABC was the only other to muster double digits, with 10.
