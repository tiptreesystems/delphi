  "question": "Will Donald Trump's net worth, according to Forbes, be between $10 billion and $20 billion (exclusive) on March 31, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.05,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here are the key facts regarding Donald Trump's net worth:\n\n1. **Current Net Worth Estimates**:\n   - As of March 11, 2025, Forbes estimates Donald Trump's net worth at $4.5 billion (Newsweek).\n   - As of February 14, 2025, Forbes estimated his net worth at $5.8 billion (The Week).\n\n2. **Recent Changes**:\n   - Trump's net worth decreased from $6 billion to $4.5 billion between January 1 and March 11, 2025 (Newsweek).\n   - In early 2024, his net worth was estimated at $2.5 billion, which increased to $6.4 billion after Truth Social's parent company went public (The Week).\n\n3. **Factors Affecting Net Worth**:\n   - High interest rates in the U.S. have negatively impacted the real estate market, where Trump has significant investments (Newsweek).\n   - Trump Media & Technology Group's value has dropped significantly, affecting Trump's stake in the company (Newsweek).\n   - Legal issues have resulted in Trump being ordered to pay $454 million, impacting his financial situation (Newsweek).\n\n4. **Volatility and Investments**:\n   - Trump's most valuable asset is a $3.5 billion stake in the parent company of Truth Social, which has experienced significant volatility (Forbes).\n   - Trump launched his own cryptocurrency, a meme coin, on January 17, 2025, which sparked significant market interest, but his net worth remains mostly derived from the Trump Organization (The Week).\n\nGiven these facts, Donald Trump's net worth is currently well below the $10 billion threshold required for the question to resolve as YES. Additionally, the volatility and recent decreases in his net worth suggest it is unlikely to rise to between $10 billion and $20 billion by March 31, 2025.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.05",

From Truth Social and real estate holdings to crypto, legal liabilities and cash — Forbes has the answer.\nsitename: Forbes\ndate: 2024-09-27\ncategories: ['Billionaires']\ntags: ['Definitive Net Worth,Donald Trump,Real Estate,Fortune,Rich,President,Trump,Net worth,Money,Wealth']\n---\n## W\n\n**hat’s Donald Trump really worth?**\n\nEveryone has an opinion, but *Forbes *has the answer: $5.6 billion, as of Nov. 4, one day before America heads to the polls. That’s $1.9 billion more than he was worth in 2016 and $3.1 billion more than in 2020. Rooted in real estate, the Trump fortune now depends on politics. His most valuable asset: a $3.5 billion stake in the publicly traded parent company to Truth Social, a right-wing Twitter knockoff that hemorrhages money and trades wildly. The value of that stake has fallen recently—from $6.3 billion last week, when Trump was worth an all-time high of $8.4 billion. But shares tend to surge when Trump’s campaign gets good news, meaning he could gain or lose billions on Election Day.\n\nBy Dan Alexander, Forbes Staff\n\nDan Alexander\n\n### 📱🌟\n\n## Truth Social’s Parent Company: **$3.5 billion**\n\nFORBES ESTIMATE AS OF NOVEMBER 4, 2024\n\n## Trump Media and Technology Group\n\n#### Net Value: **$3.5B**\n\nFrom a financial standpoint, Trump’s social-media venture is one of the most absurd businesses in America, generating sales of just $3.4 million in the 12 months through June and recording a net loss of $380 million. Revenues are down nearly 10 percent over the previous year, even while Trump dominates most news cycles. Yet Trump-loving traders bid up shares to head-scratching prices, boosting the value of Trump’s majority stake. If someone other than the former president were behind the company, investors would probably peg it near zero.\n\n### 🌭 🏢🗽\n\n## Trump’s Real Estate Investments **$1.1 billion**\n\nFORBES ESTIMATE AS OF AUGUST 2024\n\n## 1290 Avenue of the Americas\n\n#### Total Value: **$1.7B**\n\n#### Debt: **$950M**\n\n#### Net value: **$208M**\n\n#### What Trump owns: **30% stake in office and retail**\n\nThe former president has a stake in the Manhattan skyscraper that is five blocks south and one block west of Trump Tower, but he has no control over the building.

However, not all of Trump's business dealings have led to success.\n\n## What To Know\n\nAccording to* Forbes*, Trump's net worth decreased from roughly $6 billion to $4.5 billion from January 1 to March 11, 2025.\n\nPart of the reason Trump's net worth has been declining in recent years is that real estate, where the president made most of his money, has struggled amid [high interest rates](https://www.newsweek.com/investing-expert-living-high-interest-rate-world-1811985) in the United States.\n\nCompanies are also less likely to invest in real estate properties for office space as remote work continues to be popular in the United States. Retailers are also reducing their footprints as online shopping reigns supreme for many.\n\nAfter his first presidency, Trump profited from selling Trump-branded items to his supporters, including NFTs, Bibles, clothing, and shares of his social media platform, Truth Social.\n\nTrump's fortune also comes from his golf courses, mansions, winery, and a 1991 Boeing 757 nicknamed Trump Force One.\n\nHowever, some money has been held up in Trump's legal troubles. After New York Attorney General Letitia James accused Trump of lying about his net worth for business benefits, a judge ordered Trump to pay $454 million.\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group has dropped significantly in value, with a 22.3 percent decline in a single day late last year. That knocked Trump's stake in the company from about $5.9 billion to $4.6 billion.\n\n## What People Are Saying\n\n**Kevin Thompson, a finance expert and the founder and CEO of 9i Capital Group, told Newsweek:** \"The decline in Trump's net wor…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 349 words out of ~773.

And while he may not be in the same financial league as his most important supporter, Elon Musk, the president is indeed plenty wealthy.\n\nAccording to Forbes, President Trump was tied with six other people including Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings for the honor of being the 319th wealthiest person in the world in 2024. The path to the Forbes 400 has been long and winding for the 47th president, including pitfalls and reversals that nearly wiped out his fortune multiple times, as well as legal troubles that may have landed him in prison for the rest of his life had he not won the 2024 presidential election.\n\n## How did Trump amass his fortune?\n\nIn Trump's telling, he is a self-made man who built his fortune with a small loan from his father. But in \"every era of Mr. Trump's life, his finances were deeply intertwined with, and dependent on, his father's wealth,\" said [ The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-schemes-fred-trump.html); the outlet claims that his parents ultimately transferred nearly $1 billion to their children while paying almost nothing in taxes. \"Fred Trump was relentless and creative in finding ways to channel this wealth to his children,\" and much of his maneuvering was \"structured to sidestep gift and inheritance taxes using methods tax experts described to The Times as improper or possibly illegal.\"\n\n## Subscribe to The Week\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

Retailers are also reducing their footprints as online shopping reigns supreme for many.\\n\\nAfter his first presidency, Trump profited from selling Trump-branded items to his supporters, including NFTs, Bibles, clothing, and shares of his social media platform, Truth Social.\\n\\nTrump's fortune also comes from his golf courses, mansions, winery, and a 1991 Boeing 757 nicknamed Trump Force One.\\n\\nHowever, some money has been held up in Trump's legal troubles. After New York Attorney General Letitia James accused Trump of lying about his net worth for business benefits, a judge ordered Trump to pay $454 million.\\n\\nTrump Media & Technology Group has dropped significantly in value, with a 22.3 percent decline in a single day late last year. That knocked Trump's stake in the company from about $5.9 billion to $4.6 billion.\\n\\n## What People Are Saying\\n\\n**Kevin Thompson, a finance expert and the founder and CEO of 9i Capital Group, told Newsweek:** \\\"The decline in Trump's net wor\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 349 words out of ~773.

      "content": "Based on the gathered evidence, here are the key facts regarding Donald Trump's net worth:\n\n1. **Current Net Worth Estimates**:\n   - As of March 11, 2025, Forbes estimates Donald Trump's net worth at $4.5 billion (Newsweek).\n   - As of February 14, 2025, Forbes estimated his net worth at $5.8 billion (The Week).\n\n2. **Recent Changes**:\n   - Trump's net worth decreased from $6 billion to $4.5 billion between January 1 and March 11, 2025 (Newsweek).\n   - In early 2024, his net worth was estimated at $2.5 billion, which increased to $6.4 billion after Truth Social's parent company went public (The Week).\n\n3. **Factors Affecting Net Worth**:\n   - High interest rates in the U.S. have negatively impacted the real estate market, where Trump has significant investments (Newsweek).\n   - Trump Media & Technology Group's value has dropped significantly, affecting Trump's stake in the company (Newsweek).\n   - Legal issues have resulted in Trump being ordered to pay $454 million, impacting his financial situation (Newsweek).\n\n4. **Volatility and Investments**:\n   - Trump's most valuable asset is a $3.5 billion stake in the parent company of Truth Social, which has experienced significant volatility (Forbes).\n   - Trump launched his own cryptocurrency, a meme coin, on January 17, 2025, which sparked significant market interest, but his net worth remains mostly derived from the Trump Organization (The Week).\n\nGiven these facts, Donald Trump's net worth is currently well below the $10 billion threshold required for the question to resolve as YES. Additionally, the volatility and recent decreases in his net worth suggest it is unlikely to rise to between $10 billion and $20 billion by March 31, 2025.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.05"
