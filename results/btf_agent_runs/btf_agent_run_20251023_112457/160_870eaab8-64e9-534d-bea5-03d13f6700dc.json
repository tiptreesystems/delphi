  "question": "Will the number of hostages released by Hamas between January 26 and April 5, 2025 be between 30 and 39 (inclusive)?",
  "probability": 0.9,
  "reasoning": "Based on the information extracted from the sources, here are the key points relevant to the question:\n\n1. **Hostage Releases**: As of February 26, 2025, a total of 33 hostages were released by Hamas as part of a phased agreement. This release included both living hostages and the return of bodies.\n\n2. **Resolution Criteria**: The question resolves as 'YES' if the total number of hostages released by Hamas after January 26, 2025, and before April 5, 2025, is between 30 and 39 (inclusive).\n\n3. **Current Status**: The 33 hostages released by February 26, 2025, fall within the specified range of 30 to 39 hostages.\n\n4. **Ceasefire and Negotiations**: The ceasefire agreement and negotiations have been ongoing, with further releases contingent on the implementation of the ceasefire deal. However, as of the present date, no additional hostages beyond the 33 have been reported released.\n\nGiven that the number of hostages released fits the criteria and no new developments suggest additional releases beyond this number, the probability that the question resolves as 'YES' is high.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.9",

This release included both living hostages and the return of bodies.\n\n2. **Resolution Criteria**: The question resolves as 'YES' if the total number of hostages released by Hamas after January 26, 2025, and before April 5, 2025, is between 30 and 39 (inclusive).\n\n3. **Current Status**: The 33 hostages released by February 26, 2025, fall within the specified range of 30 to 39 hostages.\n\n4. **Ceasefire and Negotiations**: The ceasefire agreement and negotiations have been ongoing, with further releases contingent on the implementation of the ceasefire deal. However, as of the present date, no additional hostages beyond the 33 have been reported released.\n\nGiven that the number of hostages released fits the criteria and no new developments suggest additional releases beyond this number, the probability that the question resolves as 'YES' is high.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.9"
