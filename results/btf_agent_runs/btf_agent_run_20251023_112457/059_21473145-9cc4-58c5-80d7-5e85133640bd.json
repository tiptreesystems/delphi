And Denis Villeneuve is probably too humble to say he is the saviour of sci-fi. But for fans of the genre who have seen countless mind-blowing adventures into the outer depths of space ignored by awards bodies for so long, the Canadian is taking on that mantle whether he likes it or not.\n\nMost of us who sat ourselves in a cinema for the much-anticipated finale to Paul Atreides’s (Timothée Chalamet) revenge arc back in March 2024 did so with the kind of wide-eyed awe that Javier Bardem brought to his character, Stilgar, whenever the prophet known as the \"Lisan al-Gaib\" did as little as breathed.\n\nYet are there enough sci-fi fans on the Academy’s voting board to make this a winner? It seems unlikely. After all, if you count Guillermo del Toro’s The Shape of Water as more of a fantasy, then Everything Everywhere All At Once is the only sci-fi film in history to win Best Picture at the Oscars, demonstrating just how hard it is for such stories to take home the biggest prize.\n\n**Download the Radio Times app****for more Oscars 2025 coverage – including interviews with the stars and exclusive features.**\n\nThis is because, unfortunately, it appears many in the Academy fail to see sci-fi as *serious *business. Looking back through Best Picture winners both recent and historic, there’s often a focus on *proper *movies – cut-and-dry dramas with powerful performances, often inspired by a real-life person, real-life event – or both.\n\nBut sho…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 380 words out of ~1005.

The prediction pages reflect the current standings in the race and do not reflect personal preferences for any individual contender. As other formal (and informal) polls suggest, competitions are fluid and subject to change based on buzz and events. Predictions are updated every Thursday.\n\n**Oscars Commentary (Updated: Feb. 26, 2025)**: Oscar-winning actor Christopher Walken once said, “At its best, life is completely unpredictable.” He might as well have been talking about the current Academy Awards race.\n\nIn a year defined by industry upheaval, social media scandals and political turbulence, Hollywood’s biggest night is shaping up to be the grand finale of a season rife with chaos and brilliance. Just a few weeks ago, *Variety* — along with much of the industry — had its sights set on six possible best picture winners. Now, as the dust settles, the field has narrowed to three: “Anora,” “The Brutalist” and “Conclave.”\n\nTopping the nomination tally is Netflix’s crime musical “Emilia Pérez,” which made history with 13 nods — the most ever for a non-English-language film. But a once-soaring campaign has taken a nosedive, thanks to resurfaced offensive tweets from lead actress Karla Sofía Gascón. With the film’s best picture hopes now all but evaporated, the streamer is left hanging on to its best bets: supporting actress frontrunner Zoe Saldaña and best original song contender “El Mal.” Those aside, “Emilia” risks joining “The Turning Point” (1977) and “The Color Purple” (1985) as the most-nomi…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 368 words out of ~3135.

But *Anora* was beaten out in the best film race by *Conclave* (which also won best British film, adapted screenplay and editing), giving Focus renewed hope that it might still wind up with its first best picture Oscar winner. And **Sean Baker** lost best director to **Brady Corbet** for A24’s *The Brutalist*; best original screenplay to **Jesse Eisenberg** for Searchlight’s *A Real Pain*; and best editing to **Nick Emerson** for *Conclave*.\n\nMeanwhile, the season-long sweep of best actor by *The Brutalist*’s **Adrien Brody**, best supporting actor by **Kieran Culkin** of *…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 344 words out of ~894.

That film, which grossed more than $400 million worldwide, scored 10 nominations at the 2022 Oscars, including best picture, and swept the technical categories for its immersive and visually stunning world-building. Building on that success, “Dune: Part Two” earned $715 million worldwide, making it the fifth-highest-grossing film of the year.\n\nWhile the academy has historically been lukewarm toward sci-fi, the first “Dune” became the sixth film ever to be nominated in all seven technical categories. (The others were “Titanic,” “Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,” “Hugo,” “Mad Max: Fury Road” and “The Revenant.”) Despite earning perhaps even stronger reviews, the second installment failed to repeat that achievement.\n\nThe original “Dune” went on to win six Academy Awards, including for cinematography, production design and Hans Zimmer’s otherworldly original score. Villeneuve earned nods for co-writing and producing the first film but was notably snubbed in the directing category, an omission that rankled fans who felt his bold vision in tackling [Herbert’s notoriously unfilmable](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2021-08-24/dune-screenwriters-…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 305 words out of ~493.

That film, which grossed more than $400 million worldwide, scored 10 nominations at the 2022 Oscars, including best picture, and swept the technical categories for its immersive and visually stunning world-building. Building on that success, “Dune: Part Two” earned $715 million worldwide, making it the fifth-highest-grossing film of the year.\n\nWhile the academy has historically been lukewarm toward sci-fi, the first “Dune” became the sixth film ever to be nominated in all seven technical categories.

And Denis Villeneuve is probably too humble to say he is the saviour of sci-fi. But for fans of the genre who have seen countless mind-blowing adventures into the outer depths of space ignored by awards bodies for so long, the Canadian is taking on that mantle whether he likes it or not.\\n\\nMost of us who sat ourselves in a cinema for the much-anticipated finale to Paul Atreides\\u2019s (Timoth\\u00e9e Chalamet) revenge arc back in March 2024 did so with the kind of wide-eyed awe that Javier Bardem brought to his character, Stilgar, whenever the prophet known as the \\\"Lisan al-Gaib\\\" did as little as breathed.\\n\\nYet are there enough sci-fi fans on the Academy\\u2019s voting board to make this a winner? It seems unlikely. After all, if you count Guillermo del Toro\\u2019s The Shape of Water as more of a fantasy, then Everything Everywhere All At Once is the only sci-fi film in history to win Best Picture at the Oscars, demonstrating just how hard it is for such stories to take home the biggest prize.\\n\\n**Download the Radio Times app****for more Oscars 2025 coverage \\u2013 including interviews with the stars and exclusive features.**\\n\\nThis is because, unfortunately, it appears many in the Academy fail to see sci-fi as *serious *business. Looking back through Best Picture winners both recent and historic, there\\u2019s often a focus on *proper *movies \\u2013 cut-and-dry dramas with powerful performances, often inspired by a real-life person, real-life event \\u2013 or both.\\n\\nBut sho\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 380 words out of ~1005.
