  "question": "Will any more Russian or UK diplomats be expelled or recalled from UK or Russia, respectively, before April 8, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.85,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, diplomatic tensions between the UK and Russia have been escalating, with recent expulsions and revocations of accreditation occurring in a tit-for-tat manner. The pattern of reciprocal diplomatic actions suggests a high likelihood of further expulsions or recalls before April 8, 2025. The UK and Russia have both demonstrated a willingness to respond to each other's actions with similar measures, and the current diplomatic climate is characterized by ongoing hostility and accusations.\n\nGiven the current situation and the historical pattern of interactions, it is reasonable to estimate a high probability of further diplomatic actions, such as expulsions or recalls, occurring before the specified date.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.85",

      "content": "Based on the gathered evidence, diplomatic tensions between the UK and Russia have been escalating, with recent expulsions and revocations of accreditation occurring in a tit-for-tat manner. The pattern of reciprocal diplomatic actions suggests a high likelihood of further expulsions or recalls before April 8, 2025. The UK and Russia have both demonstrated a willingness to respond to each other's actions with similar measures, and the current diplomatic climate is characterized by ongoing hostility and accusations.\n\nGiven the current situation and the historical pattern of interactions, it is reasonable to estimate a high probability of further diplomatic actions, such as expulsions or recalls, occurring before the specified date.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.85"
