  "question": "Will Volodymyr Zelenskyy meet with Donald Trump again before April 7, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.1,
  "reasoning": "Based on the search results, here is the relevant information regarding the possibility of a meeting between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump before April 7, 2025:\n\n1. **No In-Person Meeting Confirmed**: There is no evidence from the search results indicating that an in-person meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump has occurred or is scheduled to occur between March 3 and April 7, 2025. The interactions mentioned are primarily phone calls and diplomatic discussions, not in-person meetings.\n\n2. **Phone Conversations**: There have been phone conversations between Trump and Zelenskyy, as mentioned in the articles from The Guardian and the White House. These calls were described as productive and substantive, but they do not meet the resolution criteria of an in-person meeting.\n\n3. **Diplomatic Efforts and Ceasefire Discussions**: The articles mention ongoing diplomatic efforts and discussions about a ceasefire in Ukraine, involving Trump, Zelenskyy, and other international leaders. However, these efforts have not resulted in a confirmed in-person meeting between the two leaders.\n\n4. **Trump's Schedule**: There is no indication from the search results that Trump has plans to meet Zelenskyy in person within the specified timeframe. His schedule includes discussions with other leaders and domestic political activities.\n\nGiven the lack of evidence for a scheduled or completed in-person meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump within the specified timeframe, the probability of such a meeting occurring before April 7, 2025, appears low.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1",

The interactions mentioned are primarily phone calls and diplomatic discussions, not in-person meetings.\n\n2. **Phone Conversations**: There have been phone conversations between Trump and Zelenskyy, as mentioned in the articles from The Guardian and the White House. These calls were described as productive and substantive, but they do not meet the resolution criteria of an in-person meeting.\n\n3. **Diplomatic Efforts and Ceasefire Discussions**: The articles mention ongoing diplomatic efforts and discussions about a ceasefire in Ukraine, involving Trump, Zelenskyy, and other international leaders. However, these efforts have not resulted in a confirmed in-person meeting between the two leaders.\n\n4. **Trump's Schedule**: There is no indication from the search results that Trump has plans to meet Zelenskyy in person within the specified timeframe. His schedule includes discussions with other leaders and domestic political activities.\n\nGiven the lack of evidence for a scheduled or completed in-person meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump within the specified timeframe, the probability of such a meeting occurring before April 7, 2025, appears low.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1"
