  "question": "Will the total number of forecasters in the Q1 2025 Quarterly Cup be greater than 800 forecasters?",
  "probability": 0.1,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here are the key points relevant to estimating the probability of the total number of forecasters in the Q1 2025 Quarterly Cup exceeding 800:\n\n1. **Current Participation and Predictions**:\n   - The current total number of forecasters for the Q1 2025 Quarterly Cup is 82.\n   - The community prediction for the total number of forecasters is 563, with a range from 466 to 676.\n   - The community assigns a 1.1% probability to the number of forecasters exceeding 1,200.\n\n2. **Historical Context**:\n   - In Q2 2024, the number of forecasters was 1002, but it dropped to 379 in Q4 2024, likely due to a site rewrite.\n   - Historically, the number of forecasters has fluctuated, with numbers like 842 in Q3 2023 and 838 in Q4 2023.\n\n3. **Recent Developments**:\n   - In early 2025, Metaculus launched several high-profile tournaments (ACX2025, Brazil Prediction Tournament, and Bridgewater Forecasting Contest), which led to a record number of 11,050 new user sign-ups in one week.\n   - Despite the increase in sign-ups, it is unclear how many of these new users will participate in the Quarterly Cup, as they might be more interested in the specific tournaments they signed up for.\n\n4. **Site Improvements**:\n   - The Metaculus site is described as improved in early 2025, which could potentially attract more users to participate in the Quarterly Cup.\n\nGiven these points, while there is a significant increase in user sign-ups and site improvements, the community prediction suggests a lower number of forecasters than 800. The historical trend and the current prediction both indicate that reaching over 800 forecasters is unlikely, despite the recent surge in user sign-ups.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1",

And also a bit more.\nsitename: Follow the Argument\ndate: 2023-02-21\ncategories: ['Forecasting', 'Statistics']\n---\n**TLDR**\n\n[Metaculus](http://www.metaculus.com)is a prediction platform that collects and aggregates predictions from users on a wide range of questions- An increase in the number of forecasters seems to lead to an improvement of the Metaculus community prediction. I believe this effect is real, but due to confounding effects, the analysis presented here might overestimate the improvement gained.\n- That improvement of the Metaculus community prediction seems to be approximately logarithmic, meaning that doubling the number of forecasters seems to lead to a roughly constant (albeit probably diminishing) relative improvement in performance in terms of Brier Score: Going from 100 to 200 would give you a relative improvement in Brier score almost as large as when going from 10 to 20 (e.g. an improvement by x percent). Note though, that it is a bit unclear what “an improvement in Brier score by X” actually means in terms of forecast quality.\n- Increasing the number of forecasters on Metaculus seems to not only improve performance\n*on average*, but also seems to decrease the variability of predictions, making them more stable and reliable - This analysis complements\n[another existing one](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xF8EWBouJRZpRgFgu/how-does-forecast-quantity-impact-forecast-quality-on-1)and comes to similar conclusions. Both analyses suffer from potential biases, but they are different ones.\n\nAll code used for this analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/nikosbosse/Metaculus-data-analyses).\n\n## Introduction\n\nOne of the central wisdoms in forecasting is that an ensemble of forecasts is more than the sum of its parts. Take a crowd of forecasters and average their predictions – the resulting ensemble will usually be more accurate than almost all of the individual forecasts.\n\nBut how does the performance of the ensemble change when you increase the number of forecasters? Are fifty forecasters ten times as good as five? Are five hundred even better? Charles Dillon [looked at this…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 343 words out of ~3163.

I believe this effect is real, but due to confounding effects, the analysis presented here might overestimate the improvement gained.\n- That improvement of the Metaculus community prediction seems to be approximately logarithmic, meaning that doubling the number of forecasters seems to lead to a roughly constant (albeit probably diminishing) relative improvement in performance in terms of Brier Score: Going from 100 to 200 would give you a relative improvement in Brier score almost as large as when going from 10 to 20 (e.g. an improvement by x percent). Note though, that it is a bit unclear what “an improvement in Brier score by X” actually means in terms of forecast quality.\n- Increasing the number of forecasters on Metaculus seems to not only improve performance\n*on average*, but also seems to decrease the variability of predictions, making them more stable and reliable - This analysis complements\n[another existing one](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xF8EWBouJRZpRgFgu/how-does-forecast-quantity-impact-forecast-quality-on-1)and comes to similar conclusions. Both analyses suffer from potential biases, but they are different ones.\n\nAll code used for this analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/nikosbosse/Metaculus-data-analyses).\n\n## Introduction\n\nOne of the central wisdoms in forecasting is that an ensemble of forecasts is more than the sum of its parts. Take a crowd of forecasters and average their predictions – the resulting ensemble will usually be more accurate than almost all of the individual forecasts.\n\nBut how does the performance of the ensemble change when you increase the number of forecasters? Are fifty forecasters ten times as good as five? Are five hundred even better? Charles Dillon [looked at this…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 343 words out of ~3163.

I believe this effect is real, but due to confounding effects, the analysis presented here might overestimate the improvement gained.\\n- That improvement of the Metaculus community prediction seems to be approximately logarithmic, meaning that doubling the number of forecasters seems to lead to a roughly constant (albeit probably diminishing) relative improvement in performance in terms of Brier Score: Going from 100 to 200 would give you a relative improvement in Brier score almost as large as when going from 10 to 20 (e.g. an improvement by x percent). Note though, that it is a bit unclear what \\u201can improvement in Brier score by X\\u201d actually means in terms of forecast quality.\\n- Increasing the number of forecasters on Metaculus seems to not only improve performance\\n*on average*, but also seems to decrease the variability of predictions, making them more stable and reliable - This analysis complements\\n[another existing one](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xF8EWBouJRZpRgFgu/how-does-forecast-quantity-impact-forecast-quality-on-1)and comes to similar conclusions. Both analyses suffer from potential biases, but they are different ones.\\n\\nAll code used for this analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/nikosbosse/Metaculus-data-analyses).\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nOne of the central wisdoms in forecasting is that an ensemble of forecasts is more than the sum of its parts. Take a crowd of forecasters and average their predictions \\u2013 the resulting ensemble will usually be more accurate than almost all of the individual forecasts.\\n\\nBut how does the performance of the ensemble change when you increase the number of forecasters? Are fifty forecasters ten times as good as five? Are five hundred even better? Charles Dillon [looked at this\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 343 words out of ~3163.

And also a bit more.\\nsitename: Follow the Argument\\ndate: 2023-02-21\\ncategories: ['Forecasting', 'Statistics']\\n---\\n**TLDR**\\n\\n[Metaculus](http://www.metaculus.com)is a prediction platform that collects and aggregates predictions from users on a wide range of questions- An increase in the number of forecasters seems to lead to an improvement of the Metaculus community prediction. I believe this effect is real, but due to confounding effects, the analysis presented here might overestimate the improvement gained.\\n- That improvement of the Metaculus community prediction seems to be approximately logarithmic, meaning that doubling the number of forecasters seems to lead to a roughly constant (albeit probably diminishing) relative improvement in performance in terms of Brier Score: Going from 100 to 200 would give you a relative improvement in Brier score almost as large as when going from 10 to 20 (e.g. an improvement by x percent). Note though, that it is a bit unclear what \\u201can improvement in Brier score by X\\u201d actually means in terms of forecast quality.\\n- Increasing the number of forecasters on Metaculus seems to not only improve performance\\n*on average*, but also seems to decrease the variability of predictions, making them more stable and reliable - This analysis complements\\n[another existing one](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xF8EWBouJRZpRgFgu/how-does-forecast-quantity-impact-forecast-quality-on-1)and comes to similar conclusions. Both analyses suffer from potential biases, but they are different ones.\\n\\nAll code used for this analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/nikosbosse/Metaculus-data-analyses).\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nOne of the central wisdoms in forecasting is that an ensemble of forecasts is more than the sum of its parts. Take a crowd of forecasters and average their predictions \\u2013 the resulting ensemble will usually be more accurate than almost all of the individual forecasts.\\n\\nBut how does the performance of the ensemble change when you increase the number of forecasters? Are fifty forecasters ten times as good as five? Are five hundred even better? Charles Dillon [looked at this\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 343 words out of ~3163.

      "content": "Based on the gathered evidence, here are the key points relevant to estimating the probability of the total number of forecasters in the Q1 2025 Quarterly Cup exceeding 800:\n\n1. **Current Participation and Predictions**:\n   - The current total number of forecasters for the Q1 2025 Quarterly Cup is 82.\n   - The community prediction for the total number of forecasters is 563, with a range from 466 to 676.\n   - The community assigns a 1.1% probability to the number of forecasters exceeding 1,200.\n\n2. **Historical Context**:\n   - In Q2 2024, the number of forecasters was 1002, but it dropped to 379 in Q4 2024, likely due to a site rewrite.\n   - Historically, the number of forecasters has fluctuated, with numbers like 842 in Q3 2023 and 838 in Q4 2023.\n\n3. **Recent Developments**:\n   - In early 2025, Metaculus launched several high-profile tournaments (ACX2025, Brazil Prediction Tournament, and Bridgewater Forecasting Contest), which led to a record number of 11,050 new user sign-ups in one week.\n   - Despite the increase in sign-ups, it is unclear how many of these new users will participate in the Quarterly Cup, as they might be more interested in the specific tournaments they signed up for.\n\n4. **Site Improvements**:\n   - The Metaculus site is described as improved in early 2025, which could potentially attract more users to participate in the Quarterly Cup.\n\nGiven these points, while there is a significant increase in user sign-ups and site improvements, the community prediction suggests a lower number of forecasters than 800. The historical trend and the current prediction both indicate that reaching over 800 forecasters is unlikely, despite the recent surge in user sign-ups.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1"
