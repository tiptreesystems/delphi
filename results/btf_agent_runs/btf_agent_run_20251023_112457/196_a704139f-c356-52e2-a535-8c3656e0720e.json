  "question": "Will the DC cherry trees reach peak bloom on March 28 in 2025?",
  "probability": 0.4,
  "reasoning": "Based on the information gathered, the National Park Service (NPS) has forecasted that the peak bloom for the DC cherry blossoms in 2025 is expected to occur between March 28 and March 31. This forecast is based on observations up to March 20, 2025. The peak bloom date is defined as when 70% of the Yoshino Cherry blossoms are open, and the most common time for peak bloom is between the last week of March and the first week of April.\n\nGiven that the forecast window includes March 28, and considering the historical variability and the current forecast, there is a reasonable probability that the peak bloom could indeed occur on March 28.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.4",

The trees were largely planted around the Tidal Basin near the Jefferson Memorial. Over time, some of the original trees have died, but have been replaced or propagated, to reach a total of about 3,800 trees as of 2025. Every year since 1927, the National Cherry Blossom Festival commemorates this gift with a celebration that has grown from a simple ceremony into a major cultural event drawing visitors from around the world to watch the cherries bloom, signalling the arrival of spring. The timing of the bloom varies each year, depending on weather conditions, and is carefully tracked by the National Park Service (NPS). Peak bloom is defined as the day when 70% of the Yoshino cherry blossoms are open - the Yoshino variety being the most common in the Tidal Basin. It usually happens in the last week of March or the first week of April, but extreme temperatures have resulted in peaks as early as March 15 (1990) and as late as April 18 (1958). As of the beginning of March, peak bloom is forecasted to take place between March 28 and 31. Data for past blooms can be found here.\",\"resolution_criteria\":\"This question will resolve as YES if the National Park Service (NPS) announces that the 2025 Peak Bloom date occurred on March 28. Otherwise, it will resolve as NO.\",\"fine_print\":\"If credible sources point to the peak bloom having taken place, but NPS does not officially announce a date, this question will resolve as AMBIGUOUS.\",\"present_date\":\"2025-03-25T05:53:33.004214\"}"

The peak bloom date is defined as when 70% of the Yoshino Cherry blossoms are open, and the most common time for peak bloom is between the last week of March and the first week of April.\n\nGiven that the forecast window includes March 28, and considering the historical variability and the current forecast, there is a reasonable probability that the peak bloom could indeed occur on March 28.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.4"
