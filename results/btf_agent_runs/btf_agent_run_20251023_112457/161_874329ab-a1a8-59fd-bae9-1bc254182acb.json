  "question": "Will Assassin's Creed Shadows rank between 6th and 7th on Steam's Weekly Top Sellers chart for March 18 - 25, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.4,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered information, here are the key points relevant to estimating the probability of \"Assassin's Creed Shadows\" ranking between 6th and 7th on Steam's Weekly Top Sellers chart for March 18 - 25, 2025:\n\n1. **Pre-order Sales**: As of February 18, 2025, \"Assassin's Creed Shadows\" had 300,000 pre-orders. This is significant but not as high as \"Assassin's Creed Odyssey,\" which had around 400,000-450,000 pre-orders before its release.\n\n2. **Launch Expectations**: Ubisoft announced that \"Assassin's Creed Shadows\" could have the second-largest launch in the series' history, suggesting strong sales potential.\n\n3. **Sales Predictions**: Insider Tom Henderson suggests that by the end of the first month, sales could reach 3.5 million copies, indicating strong post-launch sales expectations.\n\n4. **Release Date**: The game is set to release on March 20, 2025, which is within the relevant week for the Steam chart.\n\n5. **Steam Top Sellers**: Current data on Steam Top Sellers for the week ending March 11, 2025, does not include \"Assassin's Creed Shadows\" as it had not been released yet. However, the game's release timing and pre-order numbers suggest it could enter the top sellers list upon release.\n\nGiven these factors, \"Assassin's Creed Shadows\" is likely to perform well on the Steam Top Sellers chart due to its strong pre-order numbers and the anticipation surrounding its release. However, predicting an exact rank of 6th or 7th is challenging due to competition from other games and the variability in sales post-launch.\n\nConsidering the information, I estimate the probability of \"Assassin's Creed Shadows\" ranking between 6th and 7th on Steam's Weekly Top Sellers chart for March 18 - 25, 2025, to be moderate.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.4",

According to them, as of today, the number of pre-orders for the game has reached 300,000 copies.\n\n*Assassin’s Creed Shadows*\n\nLast week, Ubisoft [announced](https://app2top.ru/news/kvartal-naya-vy-ruchka-ubisoft-ruhnula-v-dva-raza-no-assassin-s-creed-shadows-ochen-horosho-predzakazy-vayut-227615.html) that *Assassin’s Creed Shadows* could have the second-largest launch in the series' history. This record is currently held by *Assassin’s Creed Odyssey*. According to Henderson, on the eve of its release, \"Odyssey\" had around 400,000-450,000 pre-orders. If his information is correct, *Assassin’s Creed Shadows* would need to gain another 100,000-150,000 pre-orders over the next month to surpass *Assassin’s Creed Odyssey*.\n\nHenderson also noted that over the same period, *Star Wars Outlaws* was pre-ordered by half as many people as *Assassin’s Creed Shadows*.\n\nThe insider suggests that by the end of the first month, sales of *Assassin’s Creed Shadows* could reach 3.5 million copies.\n\nAccording to Henderson, Ubisoft has no intention of delaying the game's release any further. *Assassin’s Creed Shadows* is slated to launch on March 20, 2025, on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.\n\n### Source:\n\n[Insider Gaming](https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date/)"

According to them, as of today, the number of pre-orders for the game has reached 300,000 copies. Assassin’s Creed Shadows Last week, Ubisoft announced that Assassin’s Creed Shadows could have the second-largest launch in the series' history. This record is currently held by Assassin’s Creed Odyssey. According to Henderson, on the eve of its release, \\\"Odyssey\\\" had around 400,000-450,000 pre-orders. If his information is correct, Assassin’s Creed Shadows would need to gain another 100,000-150,000 pre-orders over the next month to surpass Assassin’s Creed Odyssey. Henderson also noted that over the same period, Star Wars Outlaws was pre-ordered by half as many people as Assassin’s Creed Shadows. The insider suggests that by the end of the first month, sales of Assassin’s Creed Shadows could reach 3.5 million copies. According to Henderson, Ubisoft has no intention of delaying the game's release any further. Assassin’s Creed Shadows is slated to launch on March 20, 2025, on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.\",\"question\":\"Will Assassin's Creed Shadows rank between 6th and 7th on Steam's Weekly Top Sellers chart for March 18 - 25, 2025?\",\"background\":\"Assassin's Creed Shadows is an upcoming action role-playing game developed by Ubisoft Quebec, set to release on March 20, 2025, for PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox Series X/S, macOS, and iPadOS.

      "content": "Based on the gathered information, here are the key points relevant to estimating the probability of \"Assassin's Creed Shadows\" ranking between 6th and 7th on Steam's Weekly Top Sellers chart for March 18 - 25, 2025:\n\n1. **Pre-order Sales**: As of February 18, 2025, \"Assassin's Creed Shadows\" had 300,000 pre-orders. This is significant but not as high as \"Assassin's Creed Odyssey,\" which had around 400,000-450,000 pre-orders before its release.\n\n2. **Launch Expectations**: Ubisoft announced that \"Assassin's Creed Shadows\" could have the second-largest launch in the series' history, suggesting strong sales potential.\n\n3. **Sales Predictions**: Insider Tom Henderson suggests that by the end of the first month, sales could reach 3.5 million copies, indicating strong post-launch sales expectations.\n\n4. **Release Date**: The game is set to release on March 20, 2025, which is within the relevant week for the Steam chart.\n\n5. **Steam Top Sellers**: Current data on Steam Top Sellers for the week ending March 11, 2025, does not include \"Assassin's Creed Shadows\" as it had not been released yet. However, the game's release timing and pre-order numbers suggest it could enter the top sellers list upon release.\n\nGiven these factors, \"Assassin's Creed Shadows\" is likely to perform well on the Steam Top Sellers chart due to its strong pre-order numbers and the anticipation surrounding its release. However, predicting an exact rank of 6th or 7th is challenging due to competition from other games and the variability in sales post-launch.\n\nConsidering the information, I estimate the probability of \"Assassin's Creed Shadows\" ranking between 6th and 7th on Steam's Weekly Top Sellers chart for March 18 - 25, 2025, to be moderate.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.4"
