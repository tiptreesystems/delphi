  "question": "Will bluebird bio file for bankruptcy before April 1, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.1,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, Bluebird Bio has recently avoided bankruptcy by being acquired by private equity firms Carlyle Group and SK Capital Partners in a cash deal valued at $29 million. This acquisition was completed by the end of February 2025. The move to go private is seen as a strategy to avoid bankruptcy, allowing Bluebird Bio to focus on long-term development goals without the immediate pressure of public market demands. This suggests that the company has found a temporary resolution to its financial difficulties, at least in the short term.\n\nGiven this recent development, it is unlikely that Bluebird Bio will file for bankruptcy before April 1, 2025, as the acquisition provides a new financial structure and support to avoid such an outcome.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1",

This acquisition was completed by the end of February 2025. The move to go private is seen as a strategy to avoid bankruptcy, allowing Bluebird Bio to focus on long-term development goals without the immediate pressure of public market demands. This suggests that the company has found a temporary resolution to its financial difficulties, at least in the short term.\n\nGiven this recent development, it is unlikely that Bluebird Bio will file for bankruptcy before April 1, 2025, as the acquisition provides a new financial structure and support to avoid such an outcome.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1"
