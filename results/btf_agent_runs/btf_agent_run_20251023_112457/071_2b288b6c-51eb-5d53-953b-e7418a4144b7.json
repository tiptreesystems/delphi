  "question": "Will the ratio of the price of 1 bitcoin to 1 troy ounce of gold be between 32.0 and 38.0 (inclusive) on March 30, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.3,
  "reasoning": "To estimate the probability that the ratio of the price of 1 bitcoin to 1 troy ounce of gold will be between 32.0 and 38.0 on March 30, 2025, let's analyze the gathered information:\n\n1. **Bitcoin Price Forecast**:\n   - As of March 21, 2025, the Bitcoin price is $85,338.31.\n   - The forecasted Bitcoin price for March 30, 2025, is $125,655.64.\n\n2. **Gold Price Forecast**:\n   - As of March 23, 2025, the gold price is $3,028.20 per troy ounce.\n   - The forecasted gold price for the end of March 2025 is $3,057.\n\n3. **BTC to Gold Ratio Analysis**:\n   - The BTC to gold ratio was 36.56 in January 2025.\n   - The community prediction for the BTC to gold ratio on March 30, 2025, is 27.9, with a range of 26.5 to 29.3.\n\n4. **Calculation of the Ratio**:\n   - Using the forecasted prices: \n     - Bitcoin: $125,655.64\n     - Gold: $3,057\n   - The ratio would be approximately \\( \\frac{125,655.64}{3,057} \\approx 41.11 \\).\n\n5. **Community Prediction**:\n   - The community prediction suggests a ratio of 27.9, which is below the target range of 32.0 to 38.0.\n\nGiven the forecasted Bitcoin and gold prices, the calculated ratio exceeds the target range. However, the community prediction suggests a lower ratio, indicating uncertainty and potential volatility in the market.\n\nConsidering these factors, the probability that the ratio will be between 32.0 and 38.0 is relatively low, as the forecasted ratio is above the range, and the community prediction is below it.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.3",

For now, though, we do not see it as a viable storehold of wealth for large institutional investors, thanks mainly to a high degree of volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and operational constraints. Rather, we see it as more like buying an option on potential “digital gold”—it has a wide cone of outcomes, with one path leading to it becoming a true institutionally accepted alternative storehold of wealth.\n\n> Certainly, Bitcoin has merit: similar to gold, it cannot be devalued by central bank printing and its total supply is limited. Further, it is easily portable and exchangeable globally, especially for individuals. It also has the potential to provide diversification, though to date this is more theoretical than realized.&#x20;\n\n> Bitcoin may look especially attractive to some investors now for the same reasons that gold has been supported in the last few years. Neither gold nor Bitcoin pay a yield on an outright basis, but this matters little when yields on other assets have collapsed. And gold is one of the few assets that can do well in stagflation, an outcome likely enough that it should be considered and planned for. Moreover, in the context of high and potentially rising levels of external and internal conflict, gold has the added benefit of not being tied to the outcomes of any one country. If one were to truly accept the idea of Bitcoin as “digital gold,” you could imagine a conceptually similar case being made for Bitcoin too.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) [surged](https://www.investopedia.com/bitcoin-hits-record-high-ahead-of-trump-inauguration-crypto-meme-coins-8777270) to an all-time high in the hours before the inauguration of President Donald Trump on January 20, 2025. In the days leading up to the inauguration, policy proposals were [put forward](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/technology/trump-bitcoin-stockpile.html) to establish a US national bitcoin stockpile, although as of the first week of his presidency, the specifics of how (or whether) that might be carried out are indeterminate, coinciding with a short-term [spike in volatility](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/01/20/bitcoin-volatility-climbs-to-6-month-high-as-options-frenzy-picks-up). At the time the Bridgewater report referenced above was released (January 28, 2021), BTC was priced at \\$33,466.10, so at time of this question, it is up over 200% since that report. For its part, gold is up 50% during the time period.&#x20;\n\nGold's bull market has been fueled by [record buying](https://www.axios.com/2024/01/31/central-banks-buy-gold) of gold by many of the world's central banks, with the People's Bank of China and the National Bank of Poland notably making the metal 4% and 12% of their international reserves, respectively. According to a [recent survey](https://www.gold.org/goldhub/data/2024-central-bank-gold-reserves-survey) many central banks plan to increase their gold reserves further over the next five years.

According to a 2021 report by Bridgewater Associates: Bitcoin offers some attractive attributes, such as limited supply and global exchangeability, and is evolving quickly. For now, though, we do not see it as a viable storehold of wealth for large institutional investors, thanks mainly to a high degree of volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and operational constraints. Rather, we see it as more like buying an option on potential “digital gold”—it has a wide cone of outcomes, with one path leading to it becoming a true institutionally accepted alternative storehold of wealth. Certainly, Bitcoin has merit: similar to gold, it cannot be devalued by central bank printing and its total supply is limited. Further, it is easily portable and exchangeable globally, especially for individuals. It also has the potential to provide diversification, though to date this is more theoretical than realized. Bitcoin may look especially attractive to some investors now for the same reasons that gold has been supported in the last few years. Neither gold nor Bitcoin pay a yield on an outright basis, but this matters little when yields on other assets have collapsed. And gold is one of the few assets that can do well in stagflation, an outcome likely enough that it should be considered and planned for. Moreover, in the context of high and potentially rising levels of external and internal conflict, gold has the added benefit of not being tied to the outcomes of any one country. If one were to truly accept the idea of Bitcoin as “digital gold,” you could imagine a conceptually similar case being made for Bitcoin too. Bitcoin (BTC) surged to an all-time high in the hours before the inauguration of President Donald Trump on January 20, 2025. In the days leading up to the inauguration, policy proposals were put forward to establish a US national bitcoin stockpile, although as of the first week of his presidency, the specifics of how (or whether) that might be carried out are indeterminate, coinciding with a short-term spike in volatility. At the time the Bridgewater report referenced above was released (January 28, 2021), BTC was priced at $33,466.10, so at time of this question, it is up over 200% since that report. For its part, gold is up 50% during the time period. Gold's bull market has been fueled by record buying of gold by many of the world's central banks, with the People's Bank of China and the National Bank of Poland notably making the metal 4% and 12% of their international reserves, respectively. According to a recent survey many central banks plan to increase their gold reserves further over the next five years. From the perspective of industry experts, gold offers central banks advantages when it comes to inflation hedging, diversification and stability—particularly during times of financial crisis. A spreadsheet of the BTC/gold ratio from the beginning of 2023 to the time of this question can be found here. Looking at end-of-month figures, the ratio has been as follows: January 2023: 11.93, February 2023: 12.68, March 2023: 14.25, April 2023: 14.63, May 2023: 13.77, June 2023: 15.89, July 2023: 14.62, August 2023: 13.15, September 2023: 14.45, October 2023: 17.28, November 2023: 18.25, December 2023: 20.41, January 2024: 20.76, February 2024: 29.99, March 2024: 31.87, April 2024: 25.77, May 2024: 28.98, June 2024: 26.01, July 2024: 26.96, August 2024: 23.44, September 2024: 24.19, October 2024: 25.82, November 2024: 36.07, December 2024: 35.29, January 2025: 36.56.\", \"resolution_criteria\": \"This question resolves as YES if the ratio of the price of one bitcoin (BTC) in US dollars to gold in USD per troy ounce on March 30, 2025 is between 32.0 and 38.0 (inclusive), according to Google Finance when accessed by Metaculus on March 31, 2025. The ratio will be rounded to the nearest hundredth. Specifically, the price of BTC will be divided by the COMEX Gold Futures price. For example, for January 31, 2025, Google Finance displays $104,008.80 for BTC and $2,845.20 for gold. The ratio would therefore be 36.56.

According to a 2021 report by Bridgewater Associates: Bitcoin offers some attractive attributes, such as limited supply and global exchangeability, and is evolving quickly. For now, though, we do not see it as a viable storehold of wealth for large institutional investors, thanks mainly to a high degree of volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and operational constraints. Rather, we see it as more like buying an option on potential “digital gold”—it has a wide cone of outcomes, with one path leading to it becoming a true institutionally accepted alternative storehold of wealth. Certainly, Bitcoin has merit: similar to gold, it cannot be devalued by central bank printing and its total supply is limited. Further, it is easily portable and exchangeable globally, especially for individuals. It also has the potential to provide diversification, though to date this is more theoretical than realized. Bitcoin may look especially attractive to some investors now for the same reasons that gold has been supported in the last few years. Neither gold nor Bitcoin pay a yield on an outright basis, but this matters little when yields on other assets have collapsed. And gold is one of the few assets that can do well in stagflation, an outcome likely enough that it should be considered and planned for. Moreover, in the context of high and potentially rising levels of external and internal conflict, gold has the added benefit of not being tied to the outcomes of any one country. If one were to truly accept the idea of Bitcoin as “digital gold,” you could imagine a conceptually similar case being made for Bitcoin too. Bitcoin (BTC) surged to an all-time high in the hours before the inauguration of President Donald Trump on January 20, 2025. In the days leading up to the inauguration, policy proposals were put forward to establish a US national bitcoin stockpile, although as of the first week of his presidency, the specifics of how (or whether) that might be carried out are indeterminate, coinciding with a short-term spike in volatility. At the time the Bridgewater report referenced above was released (January 28, 2021), BTC was priced at $33,466.10, so at time of this question, it is up over 200% since that report. For its part, gold is up 50% during the time period. Gold's bull market has been fueled by record buying of gold by many of the world's central banks, with the People's Bank of China and the National Bank of Poland notably making the metal 4% and 12% of their international reserves, respectively. According to a recent survey many central banks plan to increase their gold reserves further over the next five years. From the perspective of industry experts, gold offers central banks advantages when it comes to inflation hedging, diversification and stability—particularly during times of financial crisis.

However, the community prediction suggests a lower ratio, indicating uncertainty and potential volatility in the market.\n\nConsidering these factors, the probability that the ratio will be between 32.0 and 38.0 is relatively low, as the forecasted ratio is above the range, and the community prediction is below it.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.3"
