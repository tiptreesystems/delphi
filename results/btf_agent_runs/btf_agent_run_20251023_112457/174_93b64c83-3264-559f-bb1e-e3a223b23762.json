  "question": "Will Amazon be the world's most valuable company by market cap on March 29, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.05,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered information, here are the current market capitalizations for the companies in question as of March 2025:\n\n1. **Amazon**: Approximately $2.097 trillion USD.\n2. **Apple**: Approximately $3.187 trillion USD.\n3. **Microsoft**: Approximately $2.883 trillion USD.\n4. **Nvidia**: Approximately $2.850 trillion USD.\n\nFrom these figures, Apple is currently the most valuable company by market capitalization, followed by Microsoft, Nvidia, and then Amazon. Amazon's market cap is significantly lower than Apple's, and there is no indication that Amazon will surpass Apple by March 29, 2025.\n\nGiven this data, the probability that Amazon will be the world's most valuable company by market cap on March 29, 2025, is quite low.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.05",

On March 29, 2025 (a Saturday), market caps will likely reflect completed stock market trading on March 28, 2025. For context, as of question launch, Apple leads with a $3.9 trillion market cap, with companies like Nvidia ($3.4T) and Microsoft also among the world's most valuable.\nResolution criteria: This question resolves as YES if Amazon has the highest market capitalization shown by the CompaniesMarketCap website on March 29, 2025. It resolves as NO if any other company has a higher market capitalization on that date.\nFine print: In theory a company's market capitalization [is defined](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/market-capitalization) as the stock price multiplied by the number of outstanding shares. However, in practice the market cap figure can vary based on the source (typically due to disagreement over the number of outstanding shares). Therefore, the primary resolution source for this question will be https://companiesmarketcap.com/ regardless of what is shown at other sources.
