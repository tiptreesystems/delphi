On March 29, 2025 (a Saturday), market caps will likely reflect completed stock market trading on March 28, 2025. For context, as of question launch, Apple leads with a $3.9 trillion market cap, with companies like Nvidia ($3.4T) and Microsoft also among the world's most valuable.\nResolution criteria: This question resolves as YES if Apple has the highest market capitalization shown by the CompaniesMarketCap website on March 29, 2025. It resolves as NO if any other company has a higher market capitalization on that date.\nFine print: In theory a company's market capitalization [is defined](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/market-capitalization) as the stock price multiplied by the number of outstanding shares. However, in practice the market cap figure can vary based on the source (typically due to disagreement over the number of outstanding shares). Therefore, the primary resolution source for this question will be https://companiesmarketcap.com/ regardless of what is shown at other sources.
