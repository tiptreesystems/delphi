  "question": "Will the number of lawsuits filed against the Trump Administration according to the JustSecurity tracker be greater than or equal to 41 and less than or equal to 50 on March 31, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.0,
  "reasoning": "Based on the information extracted from the Just Security litigation tracker, as of March 20, 2025, the total number of legal challenges tracked against the Trump Administration is 132 cases. This number is significantly higher than the range of 41 to 50 cases specified in the resolution criteria for the question.\n\nGiven that the number of cases is already well above the specified range, it is highly unlikely that the number of cases will decrease to fall within the range of 41 to 50 by March 31, 2025. Therefore, the probability that the number of lawsuits will be greater than or equal to 41 and less than or equal to 50 on March 31, 2025, is extremely low.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.0",

This number is significantly higher than the range of 41 to 50 cases specified in the resolution criteria for the question.\n\nGiven that the number of cases is already well above the specified range, it is highly unlikely that the number of cases will decrease to fall within the range of 41 to 50 by March 31, 2025.
