  "question": "In its March update, will Similarweb report deepseek.com being ranked in the top 50 globally?",
  "probability": 0.85,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here are the key points regarding DeepSeek's potential to be ranked in the top 50 globally by Similarweb in March 2025:\n\n1. **Traffic and Popularity**: DeepSeek has experienced explosive growth in traffic. It had 277.9 million monthly visits as of January 2025, making it the second most popular AI search engine after ChatGPT. This level of traffic is significant and suggests a strong potential for high global ranking.\n\n2. **Growth Trends**: DeepSeek's daily visits surged from 6.2 million to 12.4 million in just 48 hours by January 26, 2025. Analysts predict that DeepSeek will reach 20 million daily visits by mid-2025. This rapid growth trajectory indicates a strong upward trend in user engagement.\n\n3. **Market Presence**: DeepSeek is the #1 most downloaded app in the App Store in over 156 countries and has been integrated into products by major Chinese tech companies like Lenovo, Baidu, and Tencent. It has also caught the favor of the Chinese government, further boosting its visibility and adoption.\n\n4. **Competitive Edge**: DeepSeek's AI models are significantly cheaper than competitors, which could drive higher adoption rates. Its disruptive impact has been highlighted by triggering a $1 trillion-plus sell-off in global equities markets.\n\n5. **Global Reach**: DeepSeek's largest markets are China, India, and Indonesia, accounting for 51.24% of its monthly active users. Its global launch and strategic partnerships have contributed to its increased visibility and traffic.\n\nGiven these factors, DeepSeek's rapid growth, high traffic volume, and strategic market positioning strongly suggest that it could be ranked in the top 50 globally by Similarweb in March 2025.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.85",

While website traffic doesn’t necessarily reflect the number of unique users or the actual purpose of visiting the website, it provides a strong indication of where people are turning for AI-driven search experiences.\n\nThe most popular AI search engine to date is **ChatGPT,** with **3.8 billion** monthly visits, followed by **DeepSeek,** with **277.9 **million visits, and **Google Gemini**, with **267.70** million visits.\n\n\nLooking at the actual numbers (provided by SimilarWeb for January 2025), it's clear that ChatGPT is the leader in the AI space.\n\nDeepSeek appeared in February 2025 and quickly grabbed users' attention to check what the Chinese AI can do.
