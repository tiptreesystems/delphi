  "question": "Will \"Backspot\" win the 2025 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Film -- Limited Release?",
  "probability": 0.6,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence and reviews, \"Backspot\" appears to be a strong contender for the 2025 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Film -- Limited Release. Here are the key points supporting this assessment:\n\n1. **Fair, Accurate, and Inclusive Representation**: \"Backspot\" is directed by non-binary director D.W. Waterson and features a queer protagonist. The film addresses LGBTQ+ themes without centering on coming-out trauma, which aligns well with GLAAD's criteria for fair and inclusive representation.\n\n2. **Boldness and Originality**: The film is noted for its bold portrayal of competitive cheerleading through a queer lens. It has been compared to films like \"Black Swan\" for its serious and realistic tone, indicating originality in its approach to the sports drama genre.\n\n3. **Cultural Impact**: The film's executive producer is Elliot Page, a prominent LGBTQ+ figure, which may enhance its cultural visibility and impact. Additionally, the film's themes of mental health and body image resonate with contemporary cultural discussions.\n\n4. **Overall Quality**: Reviews highlight strong performances, particularly by Devery Jacobs, and commend the film's cinematography and direction. Despite some initial execution issues, the film is generally well-received, with many reviews noting that it \"sticks the landing.\"\n\nGiven these factors, \"Backspot\" seems to meet the criteria for the GLAAD Media Award effectively. However, the competition includes other notable films, and the final decision will depend on the subjective evaluations of the GLAAD panel.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.6",

Both sports may look refined on the outside, but they require grueling effort and intense dedication. And for us as viewers, they offer an intimate glimpse into an elite world we can admire without driving our bodies to the breaking point.\n\nNon-binary director D.W. Waterson clearly appreciates what these young female athletes can do – and make no mistake, they are athletes – while also examining the inherent contradictions of their sport. These teenagers must be pretty and powerful, sparkly yet steely, feminine yet muscular. Waterson announces this contrast early with an opening sequence from the point of view of a cheerleader performing a series of back handsprings across the floor. From inside this tumbling pass, it’s dizzying, but the tumbler herself is in complete control.\n\nNo one is more preoccupied with control on this team than Riley, whose position gives the film its title. The backspot is both the leader and anchor for all those elaborate stunts: She’s the one on the ground who ensures the tiny girls land safely after twisting and flying to the sky. Similarly, [Devery Jacobs](https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/devery-jacobs) serves as the sturdy base of this movie, even as her character is going through some emotional acrobatics of her own. The “Reservation Dogs” and “Echo” actress presents a facade of unstoppable ambition, while insecurity and anxiety roil underneath.\n\nWhen Riley, her girlfriend, Amanda ([Kudakwashe Rutendo](https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/kudakwashe-rutendo)), and their mutual best friend, Rachel ([Noa DiBerto](https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/noa-diberto)), get the opportunity to cheer for the more prestigious Thunder Hawks squad in their Canadian neighborhood, they jump at it, both literally and figuratively. The team’s leader is the exacting Eileen, played deliciously by a withering [Evan Rachel Wood](https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/evan…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 339 words out of ~670.

Waterson\n- Drama\n- Not Rated\n- 1h 33m\n\nThe nonbinary director, D.W. Waterson, wanted to make the kind of film they wished they had seen growing up in a hockey-obsessed household in Canada. Which may explain why an earnest teen spirit seems to be alive and somersaulting in “Backspot,” a cheer squad tale offering plenty of life lessons.\n\nA queer protagonist with pom-poms is not a cinematic first. (Remember the comedy “But I’m a Cheerleader”?) The double full twist with “Backspot” is that the writer, Joanne Sarazen, and Waterson (who edited and scored the film), don’t center the coming-of-age drama in coming-out trauma.\n\nFrom the get-go, Riley (Devery Jacobs of “Reservation Dogs”) and her girlfriend, Amanda (Kudakwashe Rutendo), laugh, canoodle and walk to practice hand in hand. Being queer in high school is not where the movie’s lessons lie.\n\nInstead, “Backspot” confronts mental health issues: Riley anxiously pulls out her eyebrows, has panic attacks and aches for the approval of Eileen (Evan Rachel Wood), her new coach. As the Thunderhawks’ trainer, Wood keeps her jawline taut chomping gum. Her implacable expression registers near-constant displeasure with her three eager new recruits: Riley, Amanda and Rachel (Noa DiBerto). After all, the team has only two weeks before the cheerleading championships!\n\nNot unlike its protagonist, “Backspot” initially tries too hard to be worthy of the genre in which “[Bring It On](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pg0UYb8U2Dg)” still reigns supreme. But something shifts emotionally for the anxious teen, and for the film, when Riley finds Eileen’s assistant coach, Devon (Thomas Antony Olajide)** **side-gigging as a go-go dancer.…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 350 words out of ~381.

The queer cheerleading drama directed by D.W. Waterson takes a grueling look at the physical and mental toll the sport takes on teenage females. The story, written by Joanne Sarazen, is focused on girlfriends Riley (Devery Jacobs) and Amanda (Kudakwashe Rutendo), who are vying for a spot on the all-star Thunderhawks squad led by Coach Eileen (a very good Evan Rachel Wood), who detests the famous song by Dexys Midnight Runners. With themes of body dysmorphia, peer pressure, drugs, and alcohol, the coming-of-age drama soars higher than a basket toss.\n\nThe film’s title comes from the person at the base of the cheerleading pyramid who does the count, boosts up, and supports her teammate’s ankles while ensuring the safety of the flyer (the person in the air doing a stunt). This complex task is highlighted by Devery Jacobs’s performance as Riley, the backspot for a mid-level team as they prepare for a national championship. The “Reservation Dogs” actress shines with a nuanced performance that feels authentic.\n\nAfter a dizzying first-person opening shot featuring tumbling, running, and flying, we are introduced to the key members of the story. Riley’s girlfriend Amanda (Kudakwashe Rutendo) makes cheerleading look easy. She’s the responsible and mature member of the squad who balances being an athlete with a part-time job at the local movie theater to help her mother with the bills.\n\nNoa DiBerto plays Rachel, the top girl who is chosen along with Riley and Amanda to join the all-star Thunderhawks. When she’s not acting, DiBerto is a member of the University of Western Ontario Mustangs Cheerleaders. She brings a fun element to the story as the breezy party girl.\n\n“Backspot” takes a realistic look at the competitive sport, ditching the glamour and comedy of “Bring It On” for bruised and battered bodies, loose clothing, and lots of vomiting.…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 381 words out of ~576.

Waterson’s feature debut, stars Devery Jacobs in a story about perfection and compassion in a high school cheer squad.\nsitename: Variety\ndate: 2024-05-28\ntags: ['Backspot, Devery Jacobs']\n---\nThe 21st century cheerleader is an athlete unlike any other. With a wide-eyed grin, flashy makeup and a glittering bow to match, she is required to be sturdy yet feminine; pliant yet steely. In “[Backspot](https://variety.com/t/backspot/),” D.W. Waterson’s feature directorial debut, the Canadian filmmaker has crafted a thrilling character portrait that puts those seemingly incongruent demands to the test. And, in the process, they have created a bold showcase for [Devery Jacobs](https://variety.com/t/devery-jacobs/) (“Reservation Dogs”), an actress who deftly captures the vexing tightrope walk required of young women in such a demanding, performance-driven, sport.\n\nWhat’s immediately noticeable when you first meet Riley (Jacobs) are her eyebrows. Waterson doesn’t have us fixate on them but as you witness Riley going about her cheerleading practice with, among others, her girlfriend Amanda (Kudakwashe Rutendo), you can’t help but wonder why they’re so thinned out. She’s a capable athlete whose mind is definitely on nailing her flips and her landings; her eyebrows are the only clue that maybe something’s amiss. Riley is driven, yes. Perhaps obsessively so.\n\nBy the time you see Riley outside of that tightly-wound space where she’s required to be the best possible version of herself (all while smiling and pretending to not break a sweat) and you catch her absentmindedly picking at her eyebrows, you realize the stress of high school cheerleading — on top of other stressors in her life — may be too much for her to bear.\n\nThis becomes particularly acute once she and Amanda are recruited into their dream cheer squad, the Thunderhawks. Under the strict tutelage of Eileen (Evan Rachel Wood, a welcome screen presence as always), the Thunderhawks’ stern coach, these two girls will soon be nudged toward further extremes if they are to succeed at this most demanding, if oft-derided, of sports. Riley has no time for those who’d look down on her choice of extracurricular. She knows how much of an athlete…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 373 words out of ~899.

Their new coach, a stern taskmaster named Eileen (Evan Rachel Wood), has to remind the squad to smile. Oh, yeah — isn’t cheerleading supposed to be cheerful?\n\nThe screenplay by Joanne Sarazen is as grim and obsessive as the girls. Yet, while football players can glower, cheerleaders can’t. It’s a fascinating emotional conflict, even though we only ever see the girls cheer by themselves, for themselves. Here, their sport is squarely center stage, never on** **the sidelines. The only interloper is a snotty friend-of-a-friend (Madison Seguin) who dares to insult cheerleading as anti-feminist. Riley shuts her down.\n\n“We are athletes,” Riley growls.\n\nIt’s an obvious, fist-pumping moment until another cheerleader, Laila (Marlee Sansom), jumps in — this one aggrieved that her thighs were considered too big for the top-tier team. “It’s not *just* about what we do,” Laila sighs. “Don’t be stupid.”\n\nThe actors appear to be doing their own stunts. (Jacobs and DiBerto are gymnasts; Rutendo, a former cheer captain.) The smoothness with which they can deliver a line of dialogue and then hurl themselves into a cartwheel makes their characters feel real, even though their cuts and bruises and abrasions are given more screen time than their outside lives. I spent the first stretch of the film wondering when I’d learn their age or their grade, whether they’re planning to go to college or whether they go to school at all, given their 8 a.m. practices. I never found out because, I suppose, to the girls, the outside world doesn’t matter — particularly to Jacobs’s Riley, who emerges as the most cultish of the three. If Eileen ordered her girls to shave their ponytails, Riley would instantly grab a razor.\n\n“Backspot” will probably draw comparisons to Peyton Reed’s cheeky-smart 2000 teen comedy “Bring It On,” but Sarazen seems far…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 386 words out of ~799.

The queer cheerleading drama directed by D.W. Waterson takes a grueling look at the physical and mental toll the sport takes on teenage females. The story, written by Joanne Sarazen, is focused on girlfriends Riley (Devery Jacobs) and Amanda (Kudakwashe Rutendo), who are vying for a spot on the all-star Thunderhawks squad led by Coach Eileen (a very good Evan Rachel Wood), who detests the famous song by Dexys Midnight Runners. With themes of body dysmorphia, peer pressure, drugs, and alcohol, the coming-of-age drama soars higher than a basket toss.\n\nThe film’s title comes from the person at the base of the cheerleading pyramid who does the count, boosts up, and supports her teammate’s ankles while ensuring the safety of the flyer (the person in the air doing a stunt). This complex task is highlighted by Devery Jacobs’s performance as Riley, the backspot for a mid-level team as they prepare for a national championship. The “Reservation Dogs” actress shines with a nuanced performance that feels authentic.\n\nAfter a dizzying first-person opening shot featuring tumbling, running, and flying, we are introduced to the key members of the story. Riley’s girlfriend Amanda (Kudakwashe Rutendo) makes cheerleading look easy. She’s the responsible and mature member of the squad who balances being an athlete with a part-time job at the local movie theater to help her mother with the bills.\n\nNoa DiBerto plays Rachel, the top girl who is chosen along with Riley and Amanda to join the all-star Thunderhawks. When she’s not acting, DiBerto is a member of the University of Western Ontario Mustangs Cheerleaders. She brings a fun element to the story as the breezy party girl.\n\n“Backspot” takes a realistic look at the competitive sport, ditching the glamour and comedy of “Bring It On” for bruised and battered bodies, loose clothing, and lots of vomiting.…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 381 words out of ~576.

Waterson’s feature debut, stars Devery Jacobs in a story about perfection and compassion in a high school cheer squad.\nsitename: Variety\ndate: 2024-05-28\ntags: ['Backspot, Devery Jacobs']\n---\nThe 21st century cheerleader is an athlete unlike any other. With a wide-eyed grin, flashy makeup and a glittering bow to match, she is required to be sturdy yet feminine; pliant yet steely. In “[Backspot](https://variety.com/t/backspot/),” D.W. Waterson’s feature directorial debut, the Canadian filmmaker has crafted a thrilling character portrait that puts those seemingly incongruent demands to the test. And, in the process, they have created a bold showcase for [Devery Jacobs](https://variety.com/t/devery-jacobs/) (“Reservation Dogs”), an actress who deftly captures the vexing tightrope walk required of young women in such a demanding, performance-driven, sport.\n\nWhat’s immediately noticeable when you first meet Riley (Jacobs) are her eyebrows. Waterson doesn’t have us fixate on them but as you witness Riley going about her cheerleading practice with, among others, her girlfriend Amanda (Kudakwashe Rutendo), you can’t help but wonder why they’re so thinned out. She’s a capable athlete whose mind is definitely on nailing her flips and her landings; her eyebrows are the only clue that maybe something’s amiss. Riley is driven, yes. Perhaps obsessively so.\n\nBy the time you see Riley outside of that tightly-wound space where she’s required to be the best possible version of herself (all while smiling and pretending to not break a sweat) and you catch her absentmindedly picking at her eyebrows, you realize the stress of high school cheerleading — on top of other stressors in her life — may be too much for her to bear.\n\nThis becomes particularly acute once she and Amanda are recruited into their dream cheer squad, the Thunderhawks. Under the strict tutelage of Eileen (Evan Rachel Wood, a welcome screen presence as always), the Thunderhawks’ stern coach, these two girls will soon be nudged toward further extremes if they are to succeed at this most demanding, if oft-derided, of sports. Riley has no time for those who’d look down on her choice of extracurricular. She knows how much of an athlete…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 373 words out of ~899.

With a wide-eyed grin, flashy makeup and a glittering bow to match, she is required to be sturdy yet feminine; pliant yet steely. In \\u201c[Backspot](https://variety.com/t/backspot/),\\u201d D.W. Waterson\\u2019s feature directorial debut, the Canadian filmmaker has crafted a thrilling character portrait that puts those seemingly incongruent demands to the test. And, in the process, they have created a bold showcase for [Devery Jacobs](https://variety.com/t/devery-jacobs/) (\\u201cReservation Dogs\\u201d), an actress who deftly captures the vexing tightrope walk required of young women in such a demanding, performance-driven, sport.\\n\\nWhat\\u2019s immediately noticeable when you first meet Riley (Jacobs) are her eyebrows. Waterson doesn\\u2019t have us fixate on them but as you witness Riley going about her cheerleading practice with, among others, her girlfriend Amanda (Kudakwashe Rutendo), you can\\u2019t help but wonder why they\\u2019re so thinned out. She\\u2019s a capable athlete whose mind is definitely on nailing her flips and her landings; her eyebrows are the only clue that maybe something\\u2019s amiss. Riley is driven, yes. Perhaps obsessively so.\\n\\nBy the time you see Riley outside of that tightly-wound space where she\\u2019s required to be the best possible version of herself (all while smiling and pretending to not break a sweat) and you catch her absentmindedly picking at her eyebrows, you realize the stress of high school cheerleading \\u2014 on top of other stressors in her life \\u2014 may be too much for her to bear.\\n\\nThis becomes particularly acute once she and Amanda are recruited into their dream cheer squad, the Thunderhawks. Under the strict tutelage of Eileen (Evan Rachel Wood, a welcome screen presence as always), the Thunderhawks\\u2019 stern coach, these two girls will soon be nudged toward further extremes if they are to succeed at this most demanding, if oft-derided, of sports. Riley has no time for those who\\u2019d look down on her choice of extracurricular. She knows how much of an athlete\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 373 words out of ~899.

Their new coach, a stern taskmaster named Eileen (Evan Rachel Wood), has to remind the squad to smile. Oh, yeah — isn’t cheerleading supposed to be cheerful?\n\nThe screenplay by Joanne Sarazen is as grim and obsessive as the girls. Yet, while football players can glower, cheerleaders can’t. It’s a fascinating emotional conflict, even though we only ever see the girls cheer by themselves, for themselves. Here, their sport is squarely center stage, never on** **the sidelines. The only interloper is a snotty friend-of-a-friend (Madison Seguin) who dares to insult cheerleading as anti-feminist.

(Jacobs and DiBerto are gymnasts; Rutendo, a former cheer captain.) The smoothness with which they can deliver a line of dialogue and then hurl themselves into a cartwheel makes their characters feel real, even though their cuts and bruises and abrasions are given more screen time than their outside lives. I spent the first stretch of the film wondering when I’d learn their age or their grade, whether they’re planning to go to college or whether they go to school at all, given their 8 a.m. practices. I never found out because, I suppose, to the girls, the outside world doesn’t matter — particularly to Jacobs’s Riley, who emerges as the most cultish of the three. If Eileen ordered her girls to shave their ponytails, Riley would instantly grab a razor.\n\n“Backspot” will probably draw comparisons to Peyton Reed’s cheeky-smart 2000 teen comedy “Bring It On,” but Sarazen seems far…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 386 words out of ~799.

The queer cheerleading drama directed by D.W. Waterson takes a grueling look at the physical and mental toll the sport takes on teenage females. The story, written by Joanne Sarazen, is focused on girlfriends Riley (Devery Jacobs) and Amanda (Kudakwashe Rutendo), who are vying for a spot on the all-star Thunderhawks squad led by Coach Eileen (a very good Evan Rachel Wood), who detests the famous song by Dexys Midnight Runners. With themes of body dysmorphia, peer pressure, drugs, and alcohol, the coming-of-age drama soars higher than a basket toss.\\n\\nThe film\\u2019s title comes from the person at the base of the cheerleading pyramid who does the count, boosts up, and supports her teammate\\u2019s ankles while ensuring the safety of the flyer (the person in the air doing a stunt). This complex task is highlighted by Devery Jacobs\\u2019s performance as Riley, the backspot for a mid-level team as they prepare for a national championship. The \\u201cReservation Dogs\\u201d actress shines with a nuanced performance that feels authentic.\\n\\nAfter a dizzying first-person opening shot featuring tumbling, running, and flying, we are introduced to the key members of the story. Riley\\u2019s girlfriend Amanda (Kudakwashe Rutendo) makes cheerleading look easy. She\\u2019s the responsible and mature member of the squad who balances being an athlete with a part-time job at the local movie theater to help her mother with the bills.\\n\\nNoa DiBerto plays Rachel, the top girl who is chosen along with Riley and Amanda to join the all-star Thunderhawks. When she\\u2019s not acting, DiBerto is a member of the University of Western Ontario Mustangs Cheerleaders. She brings a fun element to the story as the breezy party girl.\\n\\n\\u201cBackspot\\u201d takes a realistic look at the competitive sport, ditching the glamour and comedy of \\u201cBring It On\\u201d for bruised and battered bodies, loose clothing, and lots of vomiting.\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 381 words out of ~576.

With a wide-eyed grin, flashy makeup and a glittering bow to match, she is required to be sturdy yet feminine; pliant yet steely. In \\u201c[Backspot](https://variety.com/t/backspot/),\\u201d D.W. Waterson\\u2019s feature directorial debut, the Canadian filmmaker has crafted a thrilling character portrait that puts those seemingly incongruent demands to the test. And, in the process, they have created a bold showcase for [Devery Jacobs](https://variety.com/t/devery-jacobs/) (\\u201cReservation Dogs\\u201d), an actress who deftly captures the vexing tightrope walk required of young women in such a demanding, performance-driven, sport.\\n\\nWhat\\u2019s immediately noticeable when you first meet Riley (Jacobs) are her eyebrows. Waterson doesn\\u2019t have us fixate on them but as you witness Riley going about her cheerleading practice with, among others, her girlfriend Amanda (Kudakwashe Rutendo), you can\\u2019t help but wonder why they\\u2019re so thinned out. She\\u2019s a capable athlete whose mind is definitely on nailing her flips and her landings; her eyebrows are the only clue that maybe something\\u2019s amiss. Riley is driven, yes. Perhaps obsessively so.\\n\\nBy the time you see Riley outside of that tightly-wound space where she\\u2019s required to be the best possible version of herself (all while smiling and pretending to not break a sweat) and you catch her absentmindedly picking at her eyebrows, you realize the stress of high school cheerleading \\u2014 on top of other stressors in her life \\u2014 may be too much for her to bear.\\n\\nThis becomes particularly acute once she and Amanda are recruited into their dream cheer squad, the Thunderhawks. Under the strict tutelage of Eileen (Evan Rachel Wood, a welcome screen presence as always), the Thunderhawks\\u2019 stern coach, these two girls will soon be nudged toward further extremes if they are to succeed at this most demanding, if oft-derided, of sports. Riley has no time for those who\\u2019d look down on her choice of extracurricular. She knows how much of an athlete\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 373 words out of ~899.

Their new coach, a stern taskmaster named Eileen (Evan Rachel Wood), has to remind the squad to smile. Oh, yeah \\u2014 isn\\u2019t cheerleading supposed to be cheerful?\\n\\nThe screenplay by Joanne Sarazen is as grim and obsessive as the girls. Yet, while football players can glower, cheerleaders can\\u2019t. It\\u2019s a fascinating emotional conflict, even though we only ever see the girls cheer by themselves, for themselves. Here, their sport is squarely center stage, never on** **the sidelines. The only interloper is a snotty friend-of-a-friend (Madison Seguin) who dares to insult cheerleading as anti-feminist. Riley shuts her down.\\n\\n\\u201cWe are athletes,\\u201d Riley growls.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s an obvious, fist-pumping moment until another cheerleader, Laila (Marlee Sansom), jumps in \\u2014 this one aggrieved that her thighs were considered too big for the top-tier team. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not *just* about what we do,\\u201d Laila sighs. \\u201cDon\\u2019t be stupid.\\u201d\\n\\nThe actors appear to be doing their own stunts. (Jacobs and DiBerto are gymnasts; Rutendo, a former cheer captain.) The smoothness with which they can deliver a line of dialogue and then hurl themselves into a cartwheel makes their characters feel real, even though their cuts and bruises and abrasions are given more screen time than their outside lives. I spent the first stretch of the film wondering when I\\u2019d learn their age or their grade, whether they\\u2019re planning to go to college or whether they go to school at all, given their 8 a.m. practices. I never found out because, I suppose, to the girls, the outside world doesn\\u2019t matter \\u2014 particularly to Jacobs\\u2019s Riley, who emerges as the most cultish of the three. If Eileen ordered her girls to shave their ponytails, Riley would instantly grab a razor.\\n\\n\\u201cBackspot\\u201d will probably draw comparisons to Peyton Reed\\u2019s cheeky-smart 2000 teen comedy \\u201cBring It On,\\u201d but Sarazen seems far\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 386 words out of ~799.

Waterson, wanted to make the kind of film they wished they had seen growing up in a hockey-obsessed household in Canada. Which may explain why an earnest teen spirit seems to be alive and somersaulting in “Backspot,” a cheer squad tale offering plenty of life lessons.\\n\\nA queer protagonist with pom-poms is not a cinematic first. (Remember the comedy “But I’m a Cheerleader”?) The double full twist with “Backspot” is that the writer, Joanne Sarazen, and Waterson (who edited and scored the film), don’t center the coming-of-age drama in coming-out trauma.\\n\\nFrom the get-go, Riley (Devery Jacobs of “Reservation Dogs”) and her girlfriend, Amanda (Kudakwashe Rutendo), laugh, canoodle and walk to practice hand in hand. Being queer in high school is not where the movie’s lessons lie.\\n\\nInstead, “Backspot” confronts mental health issues: Riley anxiously pulls out her eyebrows, has panic attacks and aches for the approval of Eileen (Evan Rachel Wood), her new coach. As the Thunderhawks’ trainer, Wood keeps her jawline taut chomping gum. Her implacable expression registers near-constant displeasure with her three eager new recruits: Riley, Amanda and Rachel (Noa DiBerto). After all, the team has only two weeks before the cheerleading championships!\\n\\nNot unlike its protagonist, “Backspot” initially tries too hard to be worthy of the genre in which “Bring It On” still reigns supreme. But something shifts emotionally for the anxious teen, and for the film, when Riley finds Eileen’s assistant coach, Devon (Thomas Antony Olajide) side-gigging as a go-go dancer.\", \"question\": \"Will \\\"Backspot\\\" win the 2025 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Film -- Limited Release?\", \"background\": \"According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLAAD_Media_Award), \\\"Honorees are selected by a process involving over 700 GLAAD Media Award voters and volunteers and are evaluated using four criteria: \\\"Fair, Accurate and Inclusive Representations\\\" of the LGBT community, \\\"Boldness and Originality\\\" of the project, significant \\\"Cultural Impact\\\" on mainstream culture, and \\\"Overall Quality\\\" of the project.

The queer cheerleading drama directed by D.W. Waterson takes a grueling look at the physical and mental toll the sport takes on teenage females. The story, written by Joanne Sarazen, is focused on girlfriends Riley (Devery Jacobs) and Amanda (Kudakwashe Rutendo), who are vying for a spot on the all-star Thunderhawks squad led by Coach Eileen (a very good Evan Rachel Wood), who detests the famous song by Dexys Midnight Runners. With themes of body dysmorphia, peer pressure, drugs, and alcohol, the coming-of-age drama soars higher than a basket toss.\\n\\nThe film’s title comes from the person at the base of the cheerleading pyramid who does the count, boosts up, and supports her teammate’s ankles while ensuring the safety of the flyer (the person in the air doing a stunt). This complex task is highlighted by Devery Jacobs’s performance as Riley, the backspot for a mid-level team as they prepare for a national championship. The “Reservation Dogs” actress shines with a nuanced performance that feels authentic.\\n\\nAfter a dizzying first-person opening shot featuring tumbling, running, and flying, we are introduced to the key members of the story. Riley’s girlfriend Amanda (Kudakwashe Rutendo) makes cheerleading look easy. She’s the responsible and mature member of the squad who balances being an athlete with a part-time job at the local movie theater to help her mother with the bills.\\n\\nNoa DiBerto plays Rachel, the top girl who is chosen along with Riley and Amanda to join the all-star Thunderhawks. When she’s not acting, DiBerto is a member of the University of Western Ontario Mustangs Cheerleaders. She brings a fun element to the story as the breezy party girl.\\n\\n“Backspot” takes a realistic look at the competitive sport, ditching the glamour and comedy of “Bring It On” for bruised and battered bodies, loose clothing, and lots of vomiting.\", \"question\": \"Will \\\"Backspot\\\" win the 2025 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Film -- Limited Release?\", \"background\": \"According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLAAD_Media_Award), \\\"Honorees are selected by a process involving over 700 GLAAD Media Award voters and volunteers and are evaluated using four criteria: \\\"Fair, Accurate and Inclusive Representations\\\" of the LGBT community, \\\"Boldness and Originality\\\" of the project, significant \\\"Cultural Impact\\\" on mainstream culture, and \\\"Overall Quality\\\" of the project.

With a wide-eyed grin, flashy makeup and a glittering bow to match, she is required to be sturdy yet feminine; pliant yet steely. In “Backspot,” D.W. Waterson’s feature directorial debut, the Canadian filmmaker has crafted a thrilling character portrait that puts those seemingly incongruent demands to the test. And, in the process, they have created a bold showcase for Devery Jacobs (“Reservation Dogs”), an actress who deftly captures the vexing tightrope walk required of young women in such a demanding, performance-driven, sport.\\n\\nWhat’s immediately noticeable when you first meet Riley (Jacobs) are her eyebrows. Waterson doesn’t have us fixate on them but as you witness Riley going about her cheerleading practice with, among others, her girlfriend Amanda (Kudakwashe Rutendo), you can’t help but wonder why they’re so thinned out. She’s a capable athlete whose mind is definitely on nailing her flips and her landings; her eyebrows are the only clue that maybe something’s amiss. Riley is driven, yes. Perhaps obsessively so.\\n\\nBy the time you see Riley outside of that tightly-wound space where she’s required to be the best possible version of herself (all while smiling and pretending to not break a sweat) and you catch her absentmindedly picking at her eyebrows, you realize the stress of high school cheerleading — on top of other stressors in her life — may be too much for her to bear.\\n\\nThis becomes particularly acute once she and Amanda are recruited into their dream cheer squad, the Thunderhawks. Under the strict tutelage of Eileen (Evan Rachel Wood, a welcome screen presence as always), the Thunderhawks’ stern coach, these two girls will soon be nudged toward further extremes if they are to succeed at this most demanding, if oft-derided, of sports. Riley has no time for those who’d look down on her choice of extracurricular. She knows how much of an athlete she is, and she’s determined to prove it.\\n\\n“Backspot” is a film that demands your attention, much like its protagonist demands that of her coach.

Their new coach, a stern taskmaster named Eileen (Evan Rachel Wood), has to remind the squad to smile. Oh, yeah — isn’t cheerleading supposed to be cheerful?\\n\\nThe screenplay by Joanne Sarazen is as grim and obsessive as the girls. Yet, while football players can glower, cheerleaders can’t. It’s a fascinating emotional conflict, even though we only ever see the girls cheer by themselves, for themselves. Here, their sport is squarely center stage, never on the sidelines. The only interloper is a snotty friend-of-a-friend (Madison Seguin) who dares to insult cheerleading as anti-feminist. Riley shuts her down.\\n\\n“We are athletes,” Riley growls.\\n\\nIt’s an obvious, fist-pumping moment until another cheerleader, Laila (Marlee Sansom), jumps in — this one aggrieved that her thighs were considered too big for the top-tier team. “It’s not *just* about what we do,” Laila sighs. “Don’t be stupid.”\\n\\nThe actors appear to be doing their own stunts. (Jacobs and DiBerto are gymnasts; Rutendo, a former cheer captain.) The smoothness with which they can deliver a line of dialogue and then hurl themselves into a cartwheel makes their characters feel real, even though their cuts and bruises and abrasions are given more screen time than their outside lives. I spent the first stretch of the film wondering when I’d learn their age or their grade, whether they’re planning to go to college or whether they go to school at all, given their 8 a.m. practices. I never found out because, I suppose, to the girls, the outside world doesn’t matter — particularly to Jacobs’s Riley, who emerges as the most cultish of the three. If Eileen ordered her girls to shave their ponytails, Riley would instantly grab a razor.\\n\\n“Backspot” will probably draw comparisons to Peyton Reed’s cheeky-smart 2000 teen comedy “Bring It On,” but Sarazen seems far more interested in the darker side of the sport.\", \"question\": \"Will \\\"Backspot\\\" win the 2025 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Film -- Limited Release?\", \"background\": \"According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLAAD_Media_Award), \\\"Honorees are selected by a process involving over 700 GLAAD Media Award voters and volunteers and are evaluated using four criteria: \\\"Fair, Accurate and Inclusive Representations\\\" of the LGBT community, \\\"Boldness and Originality\\\" of the project, significant \\\"Cultural Impact\\\" on mainstream culture, and \\\"Overall Quality\\\" of the project.
