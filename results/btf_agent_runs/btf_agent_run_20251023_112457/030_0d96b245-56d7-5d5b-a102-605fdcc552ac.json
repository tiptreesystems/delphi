  "question": "Will the maximum daily average CO₂ reported by the Mauna Loa Observatory for March 1-25, 2025 be between 429.0 and 430.5 ppm (inclusive)?",
  "probability": 0.1,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here is the analysis:\n\n1. **Current CO₂ Levels**: As of March 17, 2025, the daily average CO₂ level was 427.23 ppm, and similar levels were recorded on the preceding days (March 14-16, 2025), all below the 429.0 ppm threshold.\n\n2. **Record Highs**: On March 7, 2025, a new all-time daily high of 430.60 ppm was recorded at Mauna Loa, which exceeds the upper limit of 430.5 ppm for the question.\n\n3. **Trends and Projections**: The CO₂ levels have shown a consistent upward trend, with each March recording higher levels than the previous year. The trend indicates that CO₂ levels typically peak in May, suggesting that higher averages could be expected in the coming months.\n\n4. **Resolution Criteria**: The question resolves as YES if the maximum daily average CO₂ level for March 1-25, 2025, is between 429.0 and 430.5 ppm. Given the data, the recorded high of 430.60 ppm on March 7, 2025, already exceeds the upper limit.\n\nConsidering the evidence, the probability that the maximum daily average CO₂ reported by the Mauna Loa Observatory for March 1-25, 2025, will be between 429.0 and 430.5 ppm (inclusive) is low, as the highest recorded value already exceeds this range.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1",

This is a very dangerous situation, as discussed elsewhere in this post.\n\nThe image below confirms the very high Arctic temperature anomalies in February 2025.\n\n\n\n\nThe image below illustrates the threat of a huge temperature rise. The red trend warns that the temperature could increase at a terrifying speed soon. The global surface air temperature was 13.87°C on March 8, 2025, the highest temperature on record for this day. This is the more remarkable since this record high temperature was reached during a La Niña.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe shading in the above image highlights the difference between El Niño conditions (pink shading) and La Niña conditions (blue shading). An El Niño pushes up temperatures, whereas La Niña suppresses temperatures. We're currently in a La Niña, so temperatures are suppressed, but this is predicted to end soon.

Later updates or revisions to the data after the question has resolved are immaterial.\nFine print: If a daily mean for any of the dates is missing on March 28, 2025, resolution will wait until March 31, 2025 for the data to become complete. If at that time 13 or more of the daily means are available, then the question will resolve based on that data.

The trend indicates that CO₂ levels typically peak in May, suggesting that higher averages could be expected in the coming months.\n\n4. **Resolution Criteria**: The question resolves as YES if the maximum daily average CO₂ level for March 1-25, 2025, is between 429.0 and 430.5 ppm. Given the data, the recorded high of 430.60 ppm on March 7, 2025, already exceeds the upper limit.\n\nConsidering the evidence, the probability that the maximum daily average CO₂ reported by the Mauna Loa Observatory for March 1-25, 2025, will be between 429.0 and 430.5 ppm (inclusive) is low, as the highest recorded value already exceeds this range.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1"
