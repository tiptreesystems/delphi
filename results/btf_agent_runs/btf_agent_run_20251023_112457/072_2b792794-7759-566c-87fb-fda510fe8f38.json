  "question": "Will the total market cap of the Magnificent Seven be less than 17.0 trillion USD on March 28, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.2,
  "reasoning": "Based on the information gathered, here are the key points relevant to estimating the probability that the total market cap of the Magnificent Seven will be less than 17.0 trillion USD on March 28, 2025:\n\n1. **Current Market Cap**: As of January 20, 2025, the combined market cap of the Magnificent Seven was 17.72 trillion USD. This is already above the threshold of 17.0 trillion USD.\n\n2. **Recent Performance**:\n   - Microsoft has shown a negative rate of return from March 3, 2024, to March 3, 2025, which could indicate some downward pressure on its market cap.\n   - Nvidia and Tesla have shown significant growth over the past years, but Tesla has shed some value in early 2025.\n\n3. **Market Conditions**:\n   - The US stock market was trading at about a 1% discount to fair value as of February 28, 2025, suggesting a potential undervaluation.\n   - Growth stocks, which include the Magnificent Seven, were trading at a 7% premium to fair value, indicating they might be overvalued.\n   - The communication-services sector, including Alphabet and Meta, has become more undervalued, which might suggest potential for growth or stabilization in their valuations.\n\n4. **Economic Factors**:\n   - Tariff negotiations and potential implementations are significant wild cards that could impact corporate margins and stock valuations, particularly affecting companies like Apple.\n\n5. **Analyst Predictions**:\n   - Analysts predict ongoing growth driven by advancements in AI, cloud computing, renewable energy, and the metaverse, which are areas where the Magnificent Seven are heavily involved.\n\nConsidering these factors, the current market cap is already above the 17.0 trillion USD threshold. While there are some risks and potential downward pressures, the overall growth prospects and current valuations suggest that a significant drop below 17.0 trillion USD by March 28, 2025, is unlikely.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.2",

When these groupings become popular, they often get a nickname. While the “Nifty 50,” a collection of 50 blue-chip stocks, was all the rage in the 1960s and '70s, big tech’s Magnificent 7 make headlines now. Find out which companies are in the Magnificent 7 and the potential pros and cons of investing in them.\n\n### What are the Magnificent 7 stocks?\n\nThe Magnificent 7 stocks are a group of large-cap companies (corporations with large market capitalizations determined by the number of shares times each share’s value) in the technology sector, including Alphabet (parent company of Google), Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms (parent company of Facebook and Instagram), Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. Due to their size and performance, these stocks accounted for roughly one-third of the S&P 500’s total market capitalization at the end of 2024. They also made up a significant percentage of the market’s total 2024 returns.\n\n**Why are they called the Magnificent 7?**\n\nThey’re called the Magnificent 7 because they are 7 of the best-performing companies’ growth stocks in the tech industry. The name is a nod to the classic 1960 Western film of the same name.\n\n### What stocks are in the Magnificent 7?\n\nThe Magnificent 7 consists of stocks from 7 of the world’s most well-known tech companies. They all have market capitalizations of about $1 trillion or more, with a few around $3 trillion as of March 2025. In alphabetical order, here are the companies that comprise the Magnificent 7 stocks.\n\n**Alphabet**\n\n**Ticker:**\n\nAs the ticker hints, Alphabet is the parent company of Google. The company changed its name from Google to Alphabet as they ventured outside of the search engine business. Alphabet also owns Fitbit, the fitness tracker, Waze, the traffic and navigation app, and YouTube, the video-sharing site, among others. Why are there 2 tickers for 1 company?

Divining between news that identifies a paradigm shift that will either positively or negatively affect earnings (signal) versus news that garners a lot of attention yet will not meaningfully impact a company’s business (noise).\n\nOnly two months into the year and it already feels like we have had a full year’s worth of headlines. From earnings and guidance, to the DeepSeek scare, to President Donald Trump’s on-again, off-again tariffs, volatility has risen anew.\n\nIn such an environment, what’s an investor to do? Investors should focus on the fundamentals, maintain a long-term mindset, and pay attention to valuations. And that is just what our analyst team is doing, scrutinizing the long-term fundamentals underlying sector outlooks and analyzing the long-term assumptions that drive our valuation models. Considering how fluid the situation remains as to the threats of implementing tariffs, once we have specificity on the amount of tariffs that will be implemented and a base case as to how long those tariffs may last, we will adjust our projections and valuations accordingly.\n\n## US Stock Market Valuation and Outlook\n\nAs of Feb. 28, 2025, according to a composite of our valuations, the US stock market was trading at about a 1% discount to fair value. That was the first time since a year ago (when stocks pulled back following inflation data that led to a shift in interest-rate expectations) the market has traded at a discount to a composite of our fair values.\n\n## Value Is Significantly Outperforming…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 375 words out of ~1399.

These stocks are pivotal to market indices and represent some of the most innovative and valuable firms globally.\\n\\n**What Stocks Make up The Magnificent 7?**\\n\\nThe Magnificent 7 stocks are seven of the largest, most influential, and high-growth companies in the world, typically including Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA). These companies are industry leaders in technology, e-commerce, artificial intelligence, social media, and electric vehicles. Their role as [market capitalization](https://www.wealthspire.com/financial-dictionary/market-capitalization/) leaders gives them a substantial weight in the S&P 500 and [NASDAQ](https://www.wealthspire.com/financial-dictionary/nasdaq/), meaning the performance of these 7 stocks often drives overall market trends.\\n\\n**Why Are They Called the Magnificent 7?**\\n\\nThe Magnificent 7 stocks are named after the 1960 western film: The Magnificent Seven, a nod to these stocks being the protectors and drivers of market growth, especially during times of economic uncertainty - similar to the main characters in the film.\\n\\nThe name \\\"Magnificent 7\\\" also highlights these companies' magnificent, dominant, and influential role in the global economy. These stocks have largely replaced the earlier FAANG grouping, reflecting shifts in technology leadership and the more recent inclusion of Tesla and Nvidia, which have gained prominence for their disruptive technologies.\\n\\n**What Are the FAANG Stocks?**\\n\\nFAANG stands for Facebook (now known as Meta), Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google (now called Alphabet). These 5 stocks remain some of the most well-known and top performing companies on the publicly traded stock market.

Divining between news that identifies a paradigm shift that will either positively or negatively affect earnings (signal) versus news that garners a lot of attention yet will not meaningfully impact a company\\u2019s business (noise).\\n\\nOnly two months into the year and it already feels like we have had a full year\\u2019s worth of headlines. From earnings and guidance, to the DeepSeek scare, to President Donald Trump\\u2019s on-again, off-again tariffs, volatility has risen anew.\\n\\nIn such an environment, what\\u2019s an investor to do? Investors should focus on the fundamentals, maintain a long-term mindset, and pay attention to valuations. And that is just what our analyst team is doing, scrutinizing the long-term fundamentals underlying sector outlooks and analyzing the long-term assumptions that drive our valuation models. Considering how fluid the situation remains as to the threats of implementing tariffs, once we have specificity on the amount of tariffs that will be implemented and a base case as to how long those tariffs may last, we will adjust our projections and valuations accordingly.\\n\\n## US Stock Market Valuation and Outlook\\n\\nAs of Feb. 28, 2025, according to a composite of our valuations, the US stock market was trading at about a 1% discount to fair value. That was the first time since a year ago (when stocks pulled back following inflation data that led to a shift in interest-rate expectations) the market has traded at a discount to a composite of our fair values.\\n\\n## Value Is Significantly Outperforming\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 375 words out of ~1399.

      "content": "Based on the information gathered, here are the key points relevant to estimating the probability that the total market cap of the Magnificent Seven will be less than 17.0 trillion USD on March 28, 2025:\n\n1. **Current Market Cap**: As of January 20, 2025, the combined market cap of the Magnificent Seven was 17.72 trillion USD. This is already above the threshold of 17.0 trillion USD.\n\n2. **Recent Performance**:\n   - Microsoft has shown a negative rate of return from March 3, 2024, to March 3, 2025, which could indicate some downward pressure on its market cap.\n   - Nvidia and Tesla have shown significant growth over the past years, but Tesla has shed some value in early 2025.\n\n3. **Market Conditions**:\n   - The US stock market was trading at about a 1% discount to fair value as of February 28, 2025, suggesting a potential undervaluation.\n   - Growth stocks, which include the Magnificent Seven, were trading at a 7% premium to fair value, indicating they might be overvalued.\n   - The communication-services sector, including Alphabet and Meta, has become more undervalued, which might suggest potential for growth or stabilization in their valuations.\n\n4. **Economic Factors**:\n   - Tariff negotiations and potential implementations are significant wild cards that could impact corporate margins and stock valuations, particularly affecting companies like Apple.\n\n5. **Analyst Predictions**:\n   - Analysts predict ongoing growth driven by advancements in AI, cloud computing, renewable energy, and the metaverse, which are areas where the Magnificent Seven are heavily involved.\n\nConsidering these factors, the current market cap is already above the 17.0 trillion USD threshold. While there are some risks and potential downward pressures, the overall growth prospects and current valuations suggest that a significant drop below 17.0 trillion USD by March 28, 2025, is unlikely.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.2"
