  "question": "Will the total number of posts made on Bluesky on March 30, 2025 exceed 7 million?",
  "probability": 0.75,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here are some key points regarding Bluesky's user statistics and activity:\n\n1. **User Growth**: As of March 2025, Bluesky has over 33 million registered users. The user base has grown significantly from 13 million in late October 2024 to 33 million by March 2025.\n\n2. **Daily Active Users**: Bluesky has between 1 to 10 million daily active users worldwide as of 2024. This number likely increased with the user base growth.\n\n3. **Post Activity**: Bluesky users have shared over 658 million posts in total as of January 2025. The platform has around 1.3 million daily unique posters as of November 2024.\n\n4. **Post Rate**: With 33 million users and assuming a conservative estimate of 3 million daily active users, if each active user makes an average of 2.5 posts per day, this would result in approximately 7.5 million posts per day.\n\nGiven the rapid growth in user numbers and the high level of engagement, it is plausible that the total number of posts on March 30, 2025, could exceed 7 million, especially if user activity remains high or increases.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.75",

This number likely increased with the user base growth.\n\n3. **Post Activity**: Bluesky users have shared over 658 million posts in total as of January 2025. The platform has around 1.3 million daily unique posters as of November 2024.\n\n4. **Post Rate**: With 33 million users and assuming a conservative estimate of 3 million daily active users, if each active user makes an average of 2.5 posts per day, this would result in approximately 7.5 million posts per day.\n\nGiven the rapid growth in user numbers and the high level of engagement, it is plausible that the total number of posts on March 30, 2025, could exceed 7 million, especially if user activity remains high or increases.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.75"
