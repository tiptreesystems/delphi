  "question": "Will the number of hostages released by Hamas between January 26 and April 5, 2025 be between 10 and 19 (inclusive)?",
  "probability": 0.1,
  "reasoning": "Based on the evidence gathered:\n\n1. **Hostage Releases**: As of February 26, 2025, a total of 33 hostages have been released in the first phase of the agreement, which began on January 19, 2025. The releases included 3 hostages on January 19, 4 on January 25, 3 on January 30, 3 on February 1, 3 on February 8, 3 on February 15, and 6 on February 22. This phase concluded on February 26, 2025.\n\n2. **Post-February 26 Releases**: Between February 26 and March 25, 2025, there have been no additional releases of hostages reported. The first phase of the agreement concluded with the release of 33 hostages, and subsequent phases have not been initiated due to ongoing conflicts and ceasefire violations.\n\n3. **Current Situation**: As of March 25, 2025, the ceasefire has ended, and hostilities have resumed. There is no indication of further hostage releases occurring between February 26 and March 25, 2025.\n\nGiven the information, it seems unlikely that the number of hostages released between January 26 and April 5, 2025, will fall between 10 and 19, as the releases have already exceeded this range by February 26, 2025, and no further releases have been reported.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1",

Stay updated on this pivotal development in the Israel-Gaza conflict\nsitename: AJC\ndate: 2025-01-30\ntags: ['Israel', 'History and Context: Israel-Hamas War', 'Update on Hamas-Israel War']\n---\nFebruary 27, 2025\n\nThe release of Israeli hostages by Hamas marks a significant turning point in the ongoing conflict that erupted following Hamas' massacre of Israelis on October 7, 2023. In the brutal assault, over 1,200 people were killed, and 251 individuals were taken hostage.\n\nAs part of the first phase [hostage release agreement of January 2025](https://www.ajc.org/news/israel-hamas-hostage-deal-what-you-need-to-know), 33 of the remaining hostages are slated to be freed in stages, with the first group of three Israeli women released on January 19, 2025.\n\nSince Hamas’ attack on October 7, [AJC has worked tirelessly alongside more than 50 hostage families](https://www.ajc.org/advocating-for-the-hostages), advocating globally to keep their stories front and center with officials, including over 200 members of Congress, diplomats, and faith leaders.\n\nHere is what to know about the hostage release schedule.\n\n*This explainer will continue to be updated as more information is released. AJC also breaks down what you need to know about the **Palestinian Prisoners Freed in the Hostage Agreement** and **What The Hostages Endured in Captivity*\n\n**When are the hostage releases happening? **\n\nThe first phase covers a span of six weeks and includes the release of 33 hostages, including 12 women and children, men aged 50 and above, and injured civilians, including two Americans.\n\nThree hostages were released on the first day, and four more released on the seventh day. After that, three hostages will be released every seven days, and the final 14 will be released in the final week of the first phase.\n\nIt is important to note that Hamas, a designated terror organization by multiple countries, is known for its use of psycho…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 364 words out of ~2391.

Even during the ceasefire period, Israel also continued its attacks and has imposed blockade on Gaza since March 2, albeit at a lower scale. Between 19 January and 17 March, during the ceasefire, Israel had killed at least 170 Gazans and allowed only 70% of the 600 aid trucks to be allowed in daily (AJ 18/03/2025 a). The 17 March air strikes killed at least 404 civilians (170 children and 80 women) and injured around 660. On 20 March, Israel launched additional air strikes and resumed ground operations, killing around 91 Palestinians and wounding dozens (Reuters 20/03/2025 and 18/03/2025; OCHA 18/03/2025 a; The Guardian 18/03/2025). On Monday 24 March, Israel launched several strikes killing at least 65 civilians, including children and journalists, the attacks have been registered in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, Beit Lahiya and attacks to the Red Cross building in Rafah (The Guardian 24/03/2025; France24 24/03/2025).\n\nUntil 25 March, many bodies had not been retrieved from under rubble. The death toll continues to rise as injured individuals fail to receive access to essential medicine because of Israel’s most recent and longest blockade on Gaza since 2 March. Medical facilities are also overwhelmed, with many destroyed, rendering them unable to provide adequate treatment (OCHA 18/03/2025 a; The Guardian 18/03/2025). With the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) specifically targeting hospitals and healthcare workers since October 2023, causing Gaza’s health system to collapse completely, leaving it without any capacity even before the ceasefire (Insecurity Insight 06/11/2024).\n\nUntil 25 March 2025, no safe zones had been established.

Even during the ceasefire period, Israel also continued its attacks and has imposed blockade on Gaza since March 2, albeit at a lower scale. Between 19 January and 17 March, during the ceasefire, Israel had killed at least 170 Gazans and allowed only 70% of the 600 aid trucks to be allowed in daily (AJ 18/03/2025 a). The 17 March air strikes killed at least 404 civilians (170 children and 80 women) and injured around 660. On 20 March, Israel launched additional air strikes and resumed ground operations, killing around 91 Palestinians and wounding dozens (Reuters 20/03/2025 and 18/03/2025; OCHA 18/03/2025 a; The Guardian 18/03/2025). On Monday 24 March, Israel launched several strikes killing at least 65 civilians, including children and journalists, the attacks have been registered in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, Beit Lahiya and attacks to the Red Cross building in Rafah (The Guardian 24/03/2025; France24 24/03/2025).\\n\\nUntil 25 March, many bodies had not been retrieved from under rubble. The death toll continues to rise as injured individuals fail to receive access to essential medicine because of Israel\\u2019s most recent and longest blockade on Gaza since 2 March.

The releases included 3 hostages on January 19, 4 on January 25, 3 on January 30, 3 on February 1, 3 on February 8, 3 on February 15, and 6 on February 22. This phase concluded on February 26, 2025.\n\n2. **Post-February 26 Releases**: Between February 26 and March 25, 2025, there have been no additional releases of hostages reported. The first phase of the agreement concluded with the release of 33 hostages, and subsequent phases have not been initiated due to ongoing conflicts and ceasefire violations.\n\n3. **Current Situation**: As of March 25, 2025, the ceasefire has ended, and hostilities have resumed. There is no indication of further hostage releases occurring between February 26 and March 25, 2025.\n\nGiven the information, it seems unlikely that the number of hostages released between January 26 and April 5, 2025, will fall between 10 and 19, as the releases have already exceeded this range by February 26, 2025, and no further releases have been reported.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1"
