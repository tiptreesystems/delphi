  "question": "Will Donald Trump's net worth, according to Forbes, be between $6 billion and $8 billion (exclusive) on March 31, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.05,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here are the key points regarding Donald Trump's net worth:\n\n1. **Current Net Worth**: As of March 11, 2025, Forbes estimates Donald Trump's net worth at $4.5 billion. This is a decrease from roughly $6 billion at the start of 2025.\n\n2. **Recent Changes**: Trump's net worth decreased by $1.5 billion from January 1 to March 11, 2025. This drop is attributed to the declining value of his stake in Truth Social and the impact of high interest rates on his real estate investments.\n\n3. **Volatility and Legal Issues**: Trump's financial situation is volatile, with significant fluctuations in the value of his assets, particularly his stake in Truth Social. Additionally, legal liabilities, including a $454 million payment ordered by a judge, further impact his net worth.\n\n4. **Historical Context**: In November 2024, Trump's net worth was estimated at $5.6 billion, indicating a downward trend into 2025.\n\nGiven these factors, it is highly unlikely that Donald Trump's net worth will be between $6 billion and $8 billion (exclusive) by March 31, 2025, as it is currently estimated at $4.5 billion and has been on a declining trajectory.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.05",

However, not all of Trump's business dealings have led to success.\n\n## What To Know\n\nAccording to* Forbes*, Trump's net worth decreased from roughly $6 billion to $4.5 billion from January 1 to March 11, 2025.\n\nPart of the reason Trump's net worth has been declining in recent years is that real estate, where the president made most of his money, has struggled amid [high interest rates](https://www.newsweek.com/investing-expert-living-high-interest-rate-world-1811985) in the United States.\n\nCompanies are also less likely to invest in real estate properties for office space as remote work continues to be popular in the United States. Retailers are also reducing their footprints as online shopping reigns supreme for many.\n\nAfter his first presidency, Trump profited from selling Trump-branded items to his supporters, including NFTs, Bibles, clothing, and shares of his social media platform, Truth Social.\n\nTrump's fortune also comes from his golf courses, mansions, winery, and a 1991 Boeing 757 nicknamed Trump Force One.\n\nHowever, some money has been held up in Trump's legal troubles. After New York Attorney General Letitia James accused Trump of lying about his net worth for business benefits, a judge ordered Trump to pay $454 million.\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group has dropped significantly in value, with a 22.3 percent decline in a single day late last year. That knocked Trump's stake in the company from about $5.9 billion to $4.6 billion.\n\n## What People Are Saying\n\n**Kevin Thompson, a finance expert and the founder and CEO of 9i Capital Group, told Newsweek:** \"The decline in Trump's net wor…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 349 words out of ~773.

That\\u2019s $1.9 billion more than he was worth in 2016 and $3.1 billion more than in 2020. Rooted in real estate, the Trump fortune now depends on politics. His most valuable asset: a $3.5 billion stake in the publicly traded parent company to Truth Social, a right-wing Twitter knockoff that hemorrhages money and trades wildly. The value of that stake has fallen recently\\u2014from $6.3 billion last week, when Trump was worth an all-time high of $8.4 billion.

This is a decrease from roughly $6 billion at the start of 2025.\n\n2. **Recent Changes**: Trump's net worth decreased by $1.5 billion from January 1 to March 11, 2025. This drop is attributed to the declining value of his stake in Truth Social and the impact of high interest rates on his real estate investments.\n\n3. **Volatility and Legal Issues**: Trump's financial situation is volatile, with significant fluctuations in the value of his assets, particularly his stake in Truth Social. Additionally, legal liabilities, including a $454 million payment ordered by a judge, further impact his net worth.\n\n4. **Historical Context**: In November 2024, Trump's net worth was estimated at $5.6 billion, indicating a downward trend into 2025.\n\nGiven these factors, it is highly unlikely that Donald Trump's net worth will be between $6 billion and $8 billion (exclusive) by March 31, 2025, as it is currently estimated at $4.5 billion and has been on a declining trajectory.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.05"
