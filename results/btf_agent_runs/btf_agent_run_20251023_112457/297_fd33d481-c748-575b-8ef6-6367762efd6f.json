  "question": "Will either metac-GPT4o or metac-o1 finish with a rank of 26 or lower in the Q1 2025 Quarterly Cup?",
  "probability": 0.1,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here is the analysis of the probability that either metac-GPT4o or metac-o1 will finish with a rank of 26 or lower in the Q1 2025 Quarterly Cup:\n\n1. **Community Prediction**: The community prediction for the highest rank of either metac-GPT4o or metac-o1 is 121, with a lower quartile of 64.67 and an upper quartile of 202.5. This suggests that the community expects the bots to rank well above 26, with a median prediction of 121.\n\n2. **Performance Enhancements**:\n   - **OpenAI o1**: The o1-preview model has shown strong reasoning capabilities, scoring 83% on a qualifying exam for the International Mathematics Olympiad and reaching the 89th percentile in Codeforces coding competitions. This indicates a high level of proficiency in reasoning and coding tasks, which are relevant to forecasting accuracy.\n   - **GPT-4o**: Recent updates have improved GPT-4o's performance, making it rank first in creative writing, coding, and handling hard prompts according to the Chatbot Arena LLM Leaderboard. These improvements suggest enhanced capabilities in generating accurate forecasts.\n\n3. **Probability of High Rank**: Given the community's median prediction of 121 and the performance enhancements of both models, it seems unlikely that either bot will finish with a rank of 26 or lower. The community prediction indicates a low probability of such a high rank, and the performance improvements, while significant, do not suggest a drastic enough change to overcome the community's expectations.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1",

Available now.\n\n*Update on September 17, 2024: Rate limits are now 50 queries per week for o1‑preview and 50 queries per day for o1‑mini.*\n\nWe've developed a new series of AI models designed to spend more time thinking before they respond. They can reason through complex tasks and solve harder problems than previous models in science, coding, and math.\n\nToday, we are releasing the first of this series in ChatGPT and our API. This is a preview and we expect regular updates and improvements. Alongside this release, we’re also including [evaluations](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/) for the next update, currently in development.\n\nWe trained these models to spend more time thinking through problems before they respond, much like a person would. Through training, they learn to refine their thinking process, try different strategies, and recognize their mistakes.\n\nIn our tests, the next model update performs similarly to PhD students on challenging benchmark tasks in physics, chemistry, and biology. We also found that it excels in math and coding. In a qualifying exam for the International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO), GPT‑4o correctly solved only 13% of problems, while the reasoning model scored 83%. Their coding abilities were evaluated in contests and reached the 89th percentile in Codeforces competitions. You can read more about this in our [technical research post](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/).\n\nAs an early model, it doesn't yet have many of the features that make ChatGPT useful, like browsing the web for information and uploading files and images. For many common cases GPT‑4o will be more capable in the near term.\n\nBut for complex reasoning tasks this is a significant advancement and represents a new level of AI capability. Given this, we are resetting the counter back to 1 and naming this series OpenAI o1.\n\nAs part of developing these new models, we have come up with a new safety training approach that harnesses their reasoning capabilities to make them adhere to safety and alignment guidelines. By being able to reason about our safety rules in context, it can apply them more effectively.\n\nOne way we measure safety is by testing how…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 376 words out of ~880.

It packs advanced reasoning, multimodality, and conversational capabilities into one, and with the latest update, it has become even more capable.\n\n**Also: OpenAI launches free AI training for educators - how to access it**\n\nOn Wednesday, OpenAI announced via an X post that it updated GPT-4o to improve overall performance, including better file reading and writing capabilities that allow it to generate more natural and engaging text.\n\nSo, just how good is the upgrade? Over the past week, before OpenAI announced the launch and the update, known as ChatGPT-4o (20241120), the company tested its performance on the Chatbot Arena LLM Leaderboard, a crowdsourced platform used to evaluate large language models (LLMs).\n\nUsers chatting with the two LLMs side by side and comparing their responses without knowing the models' names put GPT-4o in first place, above Gemini-Exp-1114. OpenAI also improved GPT-4o in several other categories, including creative writing, coding, and hard prompts, all of which it now ranks first in. To put them to the test yourself, you can visit the [Chatbot Arena](https://lmarena.ai/?leaderboard) and vote for free.\n\nThe update does not change how users access GPT-4o. Free users automatically have limited access, and [ChatGPT Plus](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-subscribe-to-chatgpt-plus-and-7-reasons-why-you-should/) users can select GPT-4o from the toggle model selector.\n\n**Also: This absurdly simple trick turns off AI in your Google Search results**\n\nThe ChatGPT Plus subscription guarantees users unlimited, priority access to GPT-4o, which could be useful if you rely on ChatGPT for your everyday workload. The $20 per month subscription includes other perks such as the [Advanced Voice Mode](https://www.zdnet.com/article/openais-voice-mode-rolling-out-to-all-chatgpt-subscribers-heres-who-gets-it-first/#link=%7…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 321 words out of ~328.

Available now.\n\n*Update on September 17, 2024: Rate limits are now 50 queries per week for o1‑preview and 50 queries per day for o1‑mini.*\n\nWe've developed a new series of AI models designed to spend more time thinking before they respond. They can reason through complex tasks and solve harder problems than previous models in science, coding, and math.\n\nToday, we are releasing the first of this series in ChatGPT and our API. This is a preview and we expect regular updates and improvements. Alongside this release, we’re also including [evaluations](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/) for the next update, currently in development.\n\nWe trained these models to spend more time thinking through problems before they respond, much like a person would. Through training, they learn to refine their thinking process, try different strategies, and recognize their mistakes.\n\nIn our tests, the next model update performs similarly to PhD students on challenging benchmark tasks in physics, chemistry, and biology. We also found that it excels in math and coding. In a qualifying exam for the International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO), GPT‑4o correctly solved only 13% of problems, while the reasoning model scored 83%. Their coding abilities were evaluated in contests and reached the 89th percentile in Codeforces competitions. You can read more about this in our [technical research post](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/).\n\nAs an early model, it doesn't yet have many of the features that make ChatGPT useful, like browsing the web for information and uploading files and images. For many common cases GPT‑4o will be more capable in the near term.\n\nBut for complex reasoning tasks this is a significant advancement and represents a new level of AI capability. Given this, we are resetting the counter back to 1 and naming this series OpenAI o1.\n\nAs part of developing these new models, we have come up with a new safety training approach that harnesses their reasoning capabilities to make them adhere to safety and alignment guidelines. By being able to reason about our safety rules in context, it can apply them more effectively.\n\nOne way we measure safety is by testing how…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 376 words out of ~880.

Available now.\\n\\n*Update on September 17, 2024: Rate limits are now 50 queries per week for o1\\u2011preview and 50 queries per day for o1\\u2011mini.*\\n\\nWe've developed a new series of AI models designed to spend more time thinking before they respond. They can reason through complex tasks and solve harder problems than previous models in science, coding, and math.\\n\\nToday, we are releasing the first of this series in ChatGPT and our API. This is a preview and we expect regular updates and improvements. Alongside this release, we\\u2019re also including [evaluations](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/) for the next update, currently in development.\\n\\nWe trained these models to spend more time thinking through problems before they respond, much like a person would. Through training, they learn to refine their thinking process, try different strategies, and recognize their mistakes.\\n\\nIn our tests, the next model update performs similarly to PhD students on challenging benchmark tasks in physics, chemistry, and biology. We also found that it excels in math and coding. In a qualifying exam for the International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO), GPT\\u20114o correctly solved only 13% of problems, while the reasoning model scored 83%. Their coding abilities were evaluated in contests and reached the 89th percentile in Codeforces competitions. You can read more about this in our [technical research post](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/).\\n\\nAs an early model, it doesn't yet have many of the features that make ChatGPT useful, like browsing the web for information and uploading files and images. For many common cases GPT\\u20114o will be more capable in the near term.\\n\\nBut for complex reasoning tasks this is a significant advancement and represents a new level of AI capability. Given this, we are resetting the counter back to 1 and naming this series OpenAI o1.\\n\\nAs part of developing these new models, we have come up with a new safety training approach that harnesses their reasoning capabilities to make them adhere to safety and alignment guidelines. By being able to reason about our safety rules in context, it can apply them more effectively.\\n\\nOne way we measure safety is by testing how\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 376 words out of ~880.

They can reason through complex tasks and solve harder problems than previous models in science, coding, and math.\\n\\nToday, we are releasing the first of this series in ChatGPT and our API. This is a preview and we expect regular updates and improvements. Alongside this release, we\\u2019re also including [evaluations](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/) for the next update, currently in development.\\n\\nWe trained these models to spend more time thinking through problems before they respond, much like a person would. Through training, they learn to refine their thinking process, try different strategies, and recognize their mistakes.\\n\\nIn our tests, the next model update performs similarly to PhD students on challenging benchmark tasks in physics, chemistry, and biology. We also found that it excels in math and coding. In a qualifying exam for the International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO), GPT\\u20114o correctly solved only 13% of problems, while the reasoning model scored 83%. Their coding abilities were evaluated in contests and reached the 89th percentile in Codeforces competitions. You can read more about this in our [technical research post](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/).\\n\\nAs an early model, it doesn't yet have many of the features that make ChatGPT useful, like browsing the web for information and uploading files and images. For many common cases GPT\\u20114o will be more capable in the near term.\\n\\nBut for complex reasoning tasks this is a significant advancement and represents a new level of AI capability. Given this, we are resetting the counter back to 1 and naming this series OpenAI o1.\\n\\nAs part of developing these new models, we have come up with a new safety training approach that harnesses their reasoning capabilities to make them adhere to safety and alignment guidelines. By being able to reason about our safety rules in context, it can apply them more effectively.\\n\\nOne way we measure safety is by testing how\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 376 words out of ~880.

It packs advanced reasoning, multimodality, and conversational capabilities into one, and with the latest update, it has become even more capable.\\n\\n**Also: OpenAI launches free AI training for educators - how to access it**\\n\\nOn Wednesday, OpenAI announced via an X post that it updated GPT-4o to improve overall performance, including better file reading and writing capabilities that allow it to generate more natural and engaging text.\\n\\nSo, just how good is the upgrade? Over the past week, before OpenAI announced the launch and the update, known as ChatGPT-4o (20241120), the company tested its performance on the Chatbot Arena LLM Leaderboard, a crowdsourced platform used to evaluate large language models (LLMs).\\n\\nUsers chatting with the two LLMs side by side and comparing their responses without knowing the models' names put GPT-4o in first place, above Gemini-Exp-1114. OpenAI also improved GPT-4o in several other categories, including creative writing, coding, and hard prompts, all of which it now ranks first in.

They can reason through complex tasks and solve harder problems than previous models in science, coding, and math.\\n\\nToday, we are releasing the first of this series in ChatGPT and our API. This is a preview and we expect regular updates and improvements. Alongside this release, we\\u0019re also including [evaluations](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/) for the next update, currently in development.\\n\\nWe trained these models to spend more time thinking through problems before they respond, much like a person would. Through training, they learn to refine their thinking process, try different strategies, and recognize their mistakes.\\n\\nIn our tests, the next model update performs similarly to PhD students on challenging benchmark tasks in physics, chemistry, and biology. We also found that it excels in math and coding. In a qualifying exam for the International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO), GPT\\u00114o correctly solved only 13% of problems, while the reasoning model scored 83%. Their coding abilities were evaluated in contests and reached the 89th percentile in Codeforces competitions. You can read more about this in our [technical research post](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/).\\n\\nAs an early model, it doesn't yet have many of the features that make ChatGPT useful, like browsing the web for information and uploading files and images. For many common cases GPT\\u00114o will be more capable in the near term.\\n\\nBut for complex reasoning tasks this is a significant advancement and represents a new level of AI capability. Given this, we are resetting the counter back to 1 and naming this series OpenAI o1.\\n\\nAs part of developing these new models, we have come up with a new safety training approach that harnesses their reasoning capabilities to make them adhere to safety and alignment guidelines. By being able to reason about our safety rules in context, it can apply them more effectively.\\n\\nOne way we measure safety is by testing how\\u0019\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 376 words out of ~880.

This suggests that the community expects the bots to rank well above 26, with a median prediction of 121.\n\n2. **Performance Enhancements**:\n   - **OpenAI o1**: The o1-preview model has shown strong reasoning capabilities, scoring 83% on a qualifying exam for the International Mathematics Olympiad and reaching the 89th percentile in Codeforces coding competitions. This indicates a high level of proficiency in reasoning and coding tasks, which are relevant to forecasting accuracy.\n   - **GPT-4o**: Recent updates have improved GPT-4o's performance, making it rank first in creative writing, coding, and handling hard prompts according to the Chatbot Arena LLM Leaderboard. These improvements suggest enhanced capabilities in generating accurate forecasts.\n\n3. **Probability of High Rank**: Given the community's median prediction of 121 and the performance enhancements of both models, it seems unlikely that either bot will finish with a rank of 26 or lower. The community prediction indicates a low probability of such a high rank, and the performance improvements, while significant, do not suggest a drastic enough change to overcome the community's expectations.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1"
