  "question": "Will the Great Lakes ice coverage be greater than 30.0% on March 30, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.1,
  "reasoning": "Based on the information gathered from recent reports and data on Great Lakes ice coverage:\n\n1. As of March 16, 2025, the average ice cover across the Great Lakes was approximately 13.5%. This is significantly below the 30% threshold required for a \"YES\" resolution on March 30, 2025.\n\n2. The ice season for 2024-2025 has seen near-normal ice cover compared to recent years, which had record low ice coverage. However, the peak ice cover this season was just over 50% in February due to a polar vortex, and it has since decreased significantly.\n\n3. Historical data and trends show a long-term decline in ice coverage on the Great Lakes, influenced by climate change. This trend suggests that significant increases in ice coverage late in the season are unlikely.\n\n4. The latest available data from March 15, 2025, indicates consolidated ice coverage of 15.63% across the Great Lakes, with individual lakes also showing low percentages.\n\nGiven these factors, it is unlikely that the ice coverage will increase to above 30% by March 30, 2025. Therefore, the probability of the Great Lakes ice coverage being greater than 30.0% on that date is low.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1",

During the 2023-2024 ice season, average ice cover across all five lakes was only 4.3% \\u2014 the lowest on record since scientists began recording ice cover more than 50 years ago, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The 2022-2023 season was [the fourth lowest](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2023/05/26/great-lakes-average-ice-cover-fourth-lowest-in-more-than-50-years/70075822007/) on record at about 6.2%.\\n\\nSo far this winter season, maximum ice cover peaked [at about 52%](https://apps.glerl.noaa.gov/coastwatch/webdata/statistic/ice/dat/g2024_2025_ice.dat) across the Great Lakes after February's polar vortex brought gripping cold to the region. That number is about the same as the long-term average peak.\\n\\nAs of March 16, average ice cover across the lakes was [roughly 13.5%](https://apps.glerl.noaa.gov/coastwatch/webdata/statistic/ice/dat/g2024_2025_ice.dat). And the season is far from over, as ice-off, which marks the end to the ice season, typically happens in April or early May.\\n\\nHere's what to know about the ice season so far.\\n\\n## Ice cover across the Great Lakes peaked in mid-February\\n\\nThe U.S. National\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 329 words out of ~1025.

      "content": "Based on the information gathered from recent reports and data on Great Lakes ice coverage:\n\n1. As of March 16, 2025, the average ice cover across the Great Lakes was approximately 13.5%. This is significantly below the 30% threshold required for a \"YES\" resolution on March 30, 2025.\n\n2. The ice season for 2024-2025 has seen near-normal ice cover compared to recent years, which had record low ice coverage. However, the peak ice cover this season was just over 50% in February due to a polar vortex, and it has since decreased significantly.\n\n3. Historical data and trends show a long-term decline in ice coverage on the Great Lakes, influenced by climate change. This trend suggests that significant increases in ice coverage late in the season are unlikely.\n\n4. The latest available data from March 15, 2025, indicates consolidated ice coverage of 15.63% across the Great Lakes, with individual lakes also showing low percentages.\n\nGiven these factors, it is unlikely that the ice coverage will increase to above 30% by March 30, 2025. Therefore, the probability of the Great Lakes ice coverage being greater than 30.0% on that date is low.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1"
