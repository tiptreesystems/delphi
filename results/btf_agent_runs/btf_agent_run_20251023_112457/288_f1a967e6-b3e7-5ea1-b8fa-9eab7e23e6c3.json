  "question": "Will Mike Johnson cease to be Speaker of the US House of Representatives before April 1, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.4,
  "reasoning": "Based on the information gathered:\n\n1. **Leadership Challenges**: Mike Johnson is facing internal challenges within the Republican Party. A motion to vacate has been filed by Marjorie Taylor Greene, which indicates a potential challenge to his leadership. However, some Republicans are hesitant to support this motion due to concerns it could lead to a Democratic Speaker.\n\n2. **Support and Influence**: Despite the challenges, Johnson has the public support of Donald Trump, which could help him maintain his position given Trump's influence within the GOP. Johnson is also actively involved in fundraising efforts, which bolsters his standing within the party.\n\n3. **Internal Divisions**: The Republican Party is experiencing internal divisions, with some members frustrated over Johnson's handling of certain issues. This division could affect his ability to maintain the Speaker position.\n\n4. **Precedent of Vulnerability**: The removal of Kevin McCarthy as Speaker in a similar situation highlights the vulnerability of the Speaker's position to internal party conflicts.\n\nConsidering these factors, while there is a significant challenge to Johnson's leadership, the hesitation among some Republicans to support the motion to vacate, along with Trump's support, suggests that Johnson might still retain his position. However, the situation remains precarious.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.4",

Johnson is also actively involved in fundraising efforts, which bolsters his standing within the party.\n\n3. **Internal Divisions**: The Republican Party is experiencing internal divisions, with some members frustrated over Johnson's handling of certain issues.
