  "question": "Will either metac-GPT4o or metac-o1 achieve a rank in the top 10 participants in the Q1 2025 Quarterly Cup?",
  "probability": 0.25,
  "reasoning": "Based on the evidence gathered, here are the key points relevant to estimating the probability that either metac-GPT4o or metac-o1 will achieve a rank in the top 10 participants in the Q1 2025 Quarterly Cup:\n\n1. **Community Prediction**: The community prediction for the highest rank of metac-GPT4o or metac-o1 is 29.6, with a range from 11.7 to 75.7. This suggests that while there is a possibility of ranking in the top 10, the median prediction is outside the top 10.\n\n2. **Historical Performance**: A template bot powered by o1-preview and AskNews reached 6th place in Q4, indicating that similar bots have the potential to rank highly.\n\n3. **Improving Bot Performance**: The February 19 update highlights that bots are closing the gap with human forecasters, indicating improving performance over time.\n\n4. **Competitive Environment**: The Quarterly Cup consists of 40-50 questions, providing multiple opportunities for participants to demonstrate forecasting skill. The tournament is popular, with hundreds of users forecasting on at least one question each quarter, indicating a competitive environment.\n\n5. **Statistical Analysis**: In previous benchmarking series, Pro forecasters were significantly better than top bots, but the gap is closing, suggesting that bots are becoming more competitive.\n\nTaking into account these factors, particularly the community prediction and the historical performance of similar bots, there is a reasonable chance that one of the bots could achieve a top 10 rank, but it is not highly probable given the median prediction.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.25",

Quarterly Cups have been some of the most popular tournaments on the site with hundreds of users forecasting on at least one tournament question in each quarter. In Q3 2024, Metaculus launched the [AI Forecasting Benchmark Tournament series](https://www.metaculus.com/notebooks/25525/openai-anthropic-donate-credits-for-ai-forecasting-benchmark-tournament-asknews-provides-free-news-source/), which compares bots on forecasting questions. Bots are also allowed to forecast in other questions too (although they are not included in the Community Prediction) and currently Metaculus has two bots compete in the Quarterly Cup: metac-GPT4o and metac-o1.\n\nBoth bots consist of a combination of a GPT model and AskNews for search. Both forecast every two days, using the same basic prompt (example for binary questions):\n\n> You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.Your interview question is:\n> \\{title}\n> ‎\n> Question background:\n> \\{background}\n> ‎\n> This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

      "content": "Based on the evidence gathered, here are the key points relevant to estimating the probability that either metac-GPT4o or metac-o1 will achieve a rank in the top 10 participants in the Q1 2025 Quarterly Cup:\n\n1. **Community Prediction**: The community prediction for the highest rank of metac-GPT4o or metac-o1 is 29.6, with a range from 11.7 to 75.7. This suggests that while there is a possibility of ranking in the top 10, the median prediction is outside the top 10.\n\n2. **Historical Performance**: A template bot powered by o1-preview and AskNews reached 6th place in Q4, indicating that similar bots have the potential to rank highly.\n\n3. **Improving Bot Performance**: The February 19 update highlights that bots are closing the gap with human forecasters, indicating improving performance over time.\n\n4. **Competitive Environment**: The Quarterly Cup consists of 40-50 questions, providing multiple opportunities for participants to demonstrate forecasting skill. The tournament is popular, with hundreds of users forecasting on at least one question each quarter, indicating a competitive environment.\n\n5. **Statistical Analysis**: In previous benchmarking series, Pro forecasters were significantly better than top bots, but the gap is closing, suggesting that bots are becoming more competitive.\n\nTaking into account these factors, particularly the community prediction and the historical performance of similar bots, there is a reasonable chance that one of the bots could achieve a top 10 rank, but it is not highly probable given the median prediction.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.25"
