  "question": "Will Kalshi rank between 1st and 10th (inclusive) in the iPhone Top Free Finance Apps on March 31, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.2,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here is the analysis:\n\n1. **Current Ranking**: Kalshi is not currently listed in the top 50 free finance apps on the iPhone in the US as of March 24, 2025. This suggests that it would need a significant boost to reach the top 10 by March 31, 2025.\n\n2. **Competition**: The top 10 free finance apps are dominated by well-established names like Intuit Credit Karma, Cash App, PayPal, and Venmo. These apps are strong competitors in the finance category, making it challenging for Kalshi to break into the top 10.\n\n3. **CEO's Tweet**: The CEO of Kalshi tweeted about being back in the top 10, indicating that there might have been a recent presence in the top rankings. However, this does not guarantee a sustained position.\n\n4. **App Store Dynamics**: The app rankings are updated every hour, which means positions can change frequently based on short-term trends. This volatility could work in Kalshi's favor if they manage to capitalize on a trend or promotion.\n\n5. **User Reviews and Reputation**: Kalshi has a poor Trustpilot rating of 1.9 out of 5 based on 26 reviews, with complaints about unauthorized transactions, app crashes, and poor customer service. Such negative feedback could deter new users and affect app ranking.\n\n6. **Market Perception**: Competitors like Polymarket are gaining better spotlight, suggesting that Kalshi might be losing ground in the prediction market space.\n\nConsidering the above factors, while there is a possibility for Kalshi to rank in the top 10, the current evidence points to significant challenges that make it unlikely without a major positive change in user perception or app performance.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.2",

I hadn't heard of this company until yesterday morning when I checked my transactions and I saw that they had taken $265 from my bank account. I'm not a customer, I've never been a customer, and I'm beyond livid that this has happened. I will be calling my bank when they open @ 8am this morning to dispute the charge.\n\nKalshi is definitely a scam. Especially the weather contracts. Make no mistake someone is definitely manipulating the information on multiple fronts. They either have insider information or are producing fraudulent betting odds. I watched the weather “spike” 1 degree for two min on their source every hr at the exact same time for an hr 8 time period for the temp to raise just enough to blow the betting odds 30 min before midnight. Nothing random is that perfect. The cash out also never reflected a consistent reflection of the actual live odds meaning they knew it would hit the desired outcome.\n\nBe aware that behind the guise of transparency there are clearly shady practices going on.\n\nCustomer service responds arrogantly and no accountability is taken when issues arrive from their app.\n\nIt's expected that apps have bugs at early stages but Kalshi repeatedly crashes and you frequently have issues with accessing your account/trades.\n\nI wouldn't highly recommend people stay away from this app. You can also look on X to see what their company culture/practices/reputation is like, which is why competitors like Polymarket are getting much better spotlight.\n\n## Contact info\n\n594 Broadway, Office 407 (Kalshi), 10012, NYC, United States\n\n[support@kalshi.com](mailto:support@kalshi.com)[kalshi.com](http://kalshi.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=domain_click)\n\nHasn’t replied to negative reviews\n\n\n## I don't know anythi…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 385 words out of ~2123.

      "content": "Based on the gathered evidence, here is the analysis:\n\n1. **Current Ranking**: Kalshi is not currently listed in the top 50 free finance apps on the iPhone in the US as of March 24, 2025. This suggests that it would need a significant boost to reach the top 10 by March 31, 2025.\n\n2. **Competition**: The top 10 free finance apps are dominated by well-established names like Intuit Credit Karma, Cash App, PayPal, and Venmo. These apps are strong competitors in the finance category, making it challenging for Kalshi to break into the top 10.\n\n3. **CEO's Tweet**: The CEO of Kalshi tweeted about being back in the top 10, indicating that there might have been a recent presence in the top rankings. However, this does not guarantee a sustained position.\n\n4. **App Store Dynamics**: The app rankings are updated every hour, which means positions can change frequently based on short-term trends. This volatility could work in Kalshi's favor if they manage to capitalize on a trend or promotion.\n\n5. **User Reviews and Reputation**: Kalshi has a poor Trustpilot rating of 1.9 out of 5 based on 26 reviews, with complaints about unauthorized transactions, app crashes, and poor customer service. Such negative feedback could deter new users and affect app ranking.\n\n6. **Market Perception**: Competitors like Polymarket are gaining better spotlight, suggesting that Kalshi might be losing ground in the prediction market space.\n\nConsidering the above factors, while there is a possibility for Kalshi to rank in the top 10, the current evidence points to significant challenges that make it unlikely without a major positive change in user perception or app performance.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.2"
