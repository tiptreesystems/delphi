  "question": "Will Alabama have 1.5 million or more residents living in drought on March 28, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.6,
  "reasoning": "Based on the evidence gathered:\n\n1. **Current Drought Conditions**: The U.S. Drought Monitor indicates that Alabama has experienced significant drought conditions throughout 2024, with some improvement noted in December 2024 due to increased rainfall. However, as of late February 2025, drought conditions are still being monitored and assessed, with ongoing declarations indicating persistent drought impacts.\n\n2. **Seasonal Drought Outlook**: The Climate Prediction Center's Seasonal Drought Outlook suggests that while drought conditions expanded rapidly across the United States, including the Southeast, there is potential for some alleviation due to anticipated La Niña conditions and a wetter pattern at the seasonal time scale. This could lead to some drought reductions in the Southeast, including Alabama.\n\n3. **Drought Declarations**: The ADECA's drought declarations show that drought conditions were persistent throughout 2024, with declarations issued consistently. The most recent declaration in January 2025 suggests continued monitoring and assessment, indicating that drought conditions have not been fully resolved.\n\nGiven these factors, while there is potential for improvement in drought conditions due to expected weather patterns, the persistence of drought conditions and the ongoing declarations suggest that a significant portion of Alabama may still be experiencing drought by March 28, 2025. However, the potential for improvement and the influence of La Niña conditions introduce some uncertainty.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.6",

The largest expansion of drought occurred across the southern half of California and the Four Corners states, where subnormal precipitation combined with generally above-average temperatures. Drought also expanded across the Pacific Northwest and the Southeast. In contrast, widespread heavy precipitation fell across northern California and climatologically drier regions of Oregon, the Intermountain West, and the northern High Plains, sparking some drought reductions. An extreme precipitation event brought widespread flooding to Kentucky and portions of the central Appalachians, while also sparking some drought relief across the higher elevations of the mid-Atlantic. Across the remainder of the mid-Atlantic and Northeast, an unusually long term drought continues.\n\n\nThe seasonal drought outlook for March - May 2025 is based on an anticipated continuation of La Ni�a conditions and official temperature and precipitation forecast guidance at multiple time scales. A wetter pattern is favored to develop across the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies, which should be sufficient to alleviate drought conditions that have recently developed. A wetter pattern favored at the seasonal time scale also favors some drought reductions across the Great Lakes region, but persistence is more likely a…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 363 words out of ~599.

The largest expansion of drought occurred across the southern half of California and the Four Corners states, where subnormal precipitation combined with generally above-average temperatures. Drought also expanded across the Pacific Northwest and the Southeast. In contrast, widespread heavy precipitation fell across northern California and climatologically drier regions of Oregon, the Intermountain West, and the northern High Plains, sparking some drought reductions. An extreme precipitation event brought widespread flooding to Kentucky and portions of the central Appalachians, while also sparking some drought relief across the higher elevations of the mid-Atlantic. Across the remainder of the mid-Atlantic and Northeast, an unusually long term drought continues.\\n\\n\\nThe seasonal drought outlook for March - May 2025 is based on an anticipated continuation of La Ni\\ufffda conditions and official temperature and precipitation forecast guidance at multiple time scales.

      "content": "Based on the evidence gathered:\n\n1. **Current Drought Conditions**: The U.S. Drought Monitor indicates that Alabama has experienced significant drought conditions throughout 2024, with some improvement noted in December 2024 due to increased rainfall. However, as of late February 2025, drought conditions are still being monitored and assessed, with ongoing declarations indicating persistent drought impacts.\n\n2. **Seasonal Drought Outlook**: The Climate Prediction Center's Seasonal Drought Outlook suggests that while drought conditions expanded rapidly across the United States, including the Southeast, there is potential for some alleviation due to anticipated La Niña conditions and a wetter pattern at the seasonal time scale. This could lead to some drought reductions in the Southeast, including Alabama.\n\n3. **Drought Declarations**: The ADECA's drought declarations show that drought conditions were persistent throughout 2024, with declarations issued consistently. The most recent declaration in January 2025 suggests continued monitoring and assessment, indicating that drought conditions have not been fully resolved.\n\nGiven these factors, while there is potential for improvement in drought conditions due to expected weather patterns, the persistence of drought conditions and the ongoing declarations suggest that a significant portion of Alabama may still be experiencing drought by March 28, 2025. However, the potential for improvement and the influence of La Niña conditions introduce some uncertainty.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.6"
