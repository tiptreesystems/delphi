  "question": "Will the Dallas Mavericks have between 4.6 and 4.8 million Instagram followers on March 30, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.85,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here are the key points:\n\n1. **Follower Count Drop**: The Dallas Mavericks experienced a significant drop in their Instagram followers after trading Luka Dončić to the Los Angeles Lakers. Before the trade, they had over 5.3 million followers, which dropped to 4.6 million shortly after the trade.\n\n2. **Current Follower Count**: As of the latest updates, the Mavericks' follower count was at 4.6 million. This aligns with the lower bound of the resolution criteria for the question.\n\n3. **Growth Rate**: The Mavericks' Instagram account is estimated to grow by approximately 1,659 followers per day. Given the current date is March 22, 2025, and the resolution date is March 30, 2025, there are 8 days remaining, which could potentially add about 13,272 followers to their current count.\n\n4. **Potential Follower Range**: If the current count is 4.6 million, adding the potential growth of 13,272 followers would result in a follower count of approximately 4,613,272 by March 30, 2025. This is still within the range of 4.6 to 4.8 million followers.\n\nGiven these points, the probability that the Dallas Mavericks will have between 4.6 and 4.8 million Instagram followers on March 30, 2025, is quite high, as they are currently at the lower bound of the range and are expected to grow slightly within the next few days.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.85",

In just three days, that number has plummeted to 4.6 million—a staggering loss of over 700,000 followers, with the decline showing no signs of slowing.\n\nAdding to the fallout, Dončić himself has unfollowed the Mavericks on Instagram, severing a key digital connection with the franchise. However, he continues to follow the Dallas Cowboys, signaling lingering ties to the city.\n\n**Fan Outrage and Mourning**\n\nFor Mavericks fans, the trade has been nothing short of devastating. Many gathered outside the American Airlines Center in protest, mourning the departure of the team’s cornerstone player. Some even staged a symbolic funeral, complete with a casket, to mark the end of Dončić’s era in Dallas.\n\nThe overwhelming sentiment among fans is shock and disbelief.\n\n“Luka, you were supposed to stay here forever. We love you, Luka. My kids were supposed to watch you,” said Miguel Castro, who traveled two hours from Cleburne to be at the AAC.\n\n**Viral Reactions and Social Media Frenzy**\n\nThe emotional response to the trade has sparked viral moments across social media. One particularly poignant video, posted by FOX 4, captured the raw reaction of a longtime fan, Finesse Fave, and has since amassed millions of views.\n\n“This is the worst moment of my life,” Fave lamented. “Luka filled that stadium. Who’s going to fill it now?”\n\nThe clip has been widely shared, with basketball fans remixing it alongside footage of Dončić, further amplifying the heartache. Public figures, including Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, have also weighed in, expressing their disbelief over the trade.\n\n**Trade Breakdown and What’s…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 378 words out of ~490.

Apart from the discussions generated by the move, it seems that the Texas-based franchise is paying the price for their decision.\n\nBefore the move, dubbed as \"the trade of the century,\" the Mavericks had 5.3 million followers on Instagram. Shortly after the trade, and after the initial shock gave way to disappointment, the number of followers of the 2011 NBA champions dropped to 4.6 million.\n\nOverall, since that trade, the Mavericks have lost more than 700,000 followers, which goes to show the massive frustration over the team's move.\n\nOn top of that, on Sunday noon, some fans reacted to the front office's decision to trade Doncic by gathering outside the American Airlines Center and holding a makeshift memorial.\n\nFans were holding up homemade signs, jerseys, and even candles in honor of Doncic. Others took a more fiery approach, chanting and leaving pointed messages aimed at Mavericks management, particularly General Manager Nico Harrison.\n\n[Thank you for being with us!

Apart from the discussions generated by the move, it seems that the Texas-based franchise is paying the price for their decision.\n\nBefore the move, dubbed as \"the trade of the century,\" the Mavericks had 5.3 million followers on Instagram. Shortly after the trade, and after the initial shock gave way to disappointment, the number of followers of the 2011 NBA champions dropped to 4.6 million.\n\nOverall, since that trade, the Mavericks have lost more than 700,000 followers, which goes to show the massive frustration over the team's move.\n\nOn top of that, on Sunday noon, some fans reacted to the front office's decision to trade Doncic by gathering outside the American Airlines Center and holding a makeshift memorial.\n\nFans were holding up homemade signs, jerseys, and even candles in honor of Doncic. Others took a more fiery approach, chanting and leaving pointed messages aimed at Mavericks management, particularly General Manager Nico Harrison.\n\n[Thank you for being with us!

Apart from the discussions generated by the move, it seems that the Texas-based franchise is paying the price for their decision.\\n\\nBefore the move, dubbed as \\\"the trade of the century,\\\" the Mavericks had 5.3 million followers on Instagram. Shortly after the trade, and after the initial shock gave way to disappointment, the number of followers of the 2011 NBA champions dropped to 4.6 million.\\n\\nOverall, since that trade, the Mavericks have lost more than 700,000 followers, which goes to show the massive frustration over the team's move.\\n\\nOn top of that, on Sunday noon, some fans reacted to the front office's decision to trade Doncic by gathering outside the American Airlines Center and holding a makeshift memorial.\\n\\nFans were holding up homemade signs, jerseys, and even candles in honor of Doncic. Others took a more fiery approach, chanting and leaving pointed messages aimed at Mavericks management, particularly General Manager Nico Harrison.\\n\\n[Thank you for being with us!

In just three days, that number has plummeted to 4.6 million\\u2014a staggering loss of over 700,000 followers, with the decline showing no signs of slowing.\\n\\nAdding to the fallout, Don\\u010di\\u0107 himself has unfollowed the Mavericks on Instagram, severing a key digital connection with the franchise. However, he continues to follow the Dallas Cowboys, signaling lingering ties to the city.\\n\\n**Fan Outrage and Mourning**\\n\\nFor Mavericks fans, the trade has been nothing short of devastating. Many gathered outside the American Airlines Center in protest, mourning the departure of the team\\u2019s cornerstone player. Some even staged a symbolic funeral, complete with a casket, to mark the end of Don\\u010di\\u0107\\u2019s era in Dallas.\\n\\nThe overwhelming sentiment among fans is shock and disbelief.\\n\\n\\u201cLuka, you were supposed to stay here forever.

My kids were supposed to watch you,\\u201d said Miguel Castro, who traveled two hours from Cleburne to be at the AAC.\\n\\n**Viral Reactions and Social Media Frenzy**\\n\\nThe emotional response to the trade has sparked viral moments across social media. One particularly poignant video, posted by FOX 4, captured the raw reaction of a longtime fan, Finesse Fave, and has since amassed millions of views.\\n\\n\\u201cThis is the worst moment of my life,\\u201d Fave lamented. \\u201cLuka filled that stadium.

Before the trade, the Mavericks boasted more than 5.3 million followers on Instagram. In just three days, that number has plummeted to 4.6 million—a staggering loss of over 700,000 followers, with the decline showing no signs of slowing.\\n\\nAdding to the fallout, Dončić himself has unfollowed the Mavericks on Instagram, severing a key digital connection with the franchise. However, he continues to follow the Dallas Cowboys, signaling lingering ties to the city.\\n\\nFan Outrage and Mourning\\n\\nFor Mavericks fans, the trade has been nothing short of devastating. Many gathered outside the American Airlines Center in protest, mourning the departure of the team’s cornerstone player. Some even staged a symbolic funeral, complete with a casket, to mark the end of Dončić’s era in Dallas.\\n\\nThe overwhelming sentiment among fans is shock and disbelief.\\n\\n“Luka, you were supposed to stay here forever. We love you, Luka. My kids were supposed to watch you,” said Miguel Castro, who traveled two hours from Cleburne to be at the AAC.\\n\\nViral Reactions and Social Media Frenzy\\n\\nThe emotional response to the trade has sparked viral moments across social media. One particularly poignant video, posted by FOX 4, captured the raw reaction of a longtime fan, Finesse Fave, and has since amassed millions of views.\\n\\n“This is the worst moment of my life,” Fave lamented. “Luka filled that stadium. Who’s going to fill it now?”\\n\\nThe clip has been widely shared, with basketball fans remixing it alongside footage of Dončić, further amplifying the heartache. Public figures, including Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, have also weighed in, expressing their disbelief over the trade.\", \"question\": \"Will the Dallas Mavericks have between 4.6 and 4.8 million Instagram followers on March 30, 2025?\", \"background\": \"Dallas Mavericks lose nearly 1 million Instagram followers after trading Luka Dončić to Lakers\", \"resolution_criteria\": \"This question resolves as YES if the Dallas Mavericks' Instagram follower count on March 30, 2025 is greater than or equal to 4,600,000 and less than 4,800,000, according to InsTrack\", \"present_date\": \"2025-03-22T21:54:43.823894\"}"

Before the trade, they had over 5.3 million followers, which dropped to 4.6 million shortly after the trade.\n\n2. **Current Follower Count**: As of the latest updates, the Mavericks' follower count was at 4.6 million. This aligns with the lower bound of the resolution criteria for the question.\n\n3. **Growth Rate**: The Mavericks' Instagram account is estimated to grow by approximately 1,659 followers per day. Given the current date is March 22, 2025, and the resolution date is March 30, 2025, there are 8 days remaining, which could potentially add about 13,272 followers to their current count.\n\n4. **Potential Follower Range**: If the current count is 4.6 million, adding the potential growth of 13,272 followers would result in a follower count of approximately 4,613,272 by March 30, 2025. This is still within the range of 4.6 to 4.8 million followers.\n\nGiven these points, the probability that the Dallas Mavericks will have between 4.6 and 4.8 million Instagram followers on March 30, 2025, is quite high, as they are currently at the lower bound of the range and are expected to grow slightly within the next few days.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.85"
