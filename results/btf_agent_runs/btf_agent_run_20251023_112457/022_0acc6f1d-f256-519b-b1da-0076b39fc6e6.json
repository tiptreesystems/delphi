  "question": "Will Amazon still list a 12-pack of Coca-Cola as \"SNAP EBT eligible\" on April 1, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.9,
  "reasoning": "Based on the extracted evidence, here are the key points relevant to the question:\n\n1. **Amazon's Commitment to SNAP EBT**: Amazon has been actively participating in the USDA's SNAP Online Purchasing Pilot since 2016 and has expanded SNAP EBT acceptance to nearly every state in the U.S. They have waived the Prime membership requirement for SNAP customers, indicating a strong commitment to supporting SNAP beneficiaries.\n\n2. **SNAP EBT Eligibility Label**: SNAP-eligible food items on Amazon are clearly labeled as \"SNAP EBT eligible\" once a SNAP participant adds their EBT card to their Amazon account. This labeling is crucial for identifying eligible products.\n\n3. **No Recent Policy Changes Detected**: There are no indications of recent policy changes that would affect the SNAP EBT eligibility of Coca-Cola or similar products on Amazon. The focus has been on expanding access and increasing benefits rather than restricting eligibility.\n\n4. **Stability in SNAP Benefits**: The USDA has increased maximum allotments for SNAP benefits for the fiscal year 2025, which could enhance purchasing power but does not directly impact eligibility criteria for specific products like Coca-Cola.\n\nGiven Amazon's ongoing commitment to supporting SNAP beneficiaries and the absence of any recent policy changes that would affect the eligibility of Coca-Cola, it is likely that the product will remain listed as \"SNAP EBT eligible\" on April 1, 2025.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.9",

      "content": "Based on the extracted evidence, here are the key points relevant to the question:\n\n1. **Amazon's Commitment to SNAP EBT**: Amazon has been actively participating in the USDA's SNAP Online Purchasing Pilot since 2016 and has expanded SNAP EBT acceptance to nearly every state in the U.S. They have waived the Prime membership requirement for SNAP customers, indicating a strong commitment to supporting SNAP beneficiaries.\n\n2. **SNAP EBT Eligibility Label**: SNAP-eligible food items on Amazon are clearly labeled as \"SNAP EBT eligible\" once a SNAP participant adds their EBT card to their Amazon account. This labeling is crucial for identifying eligible products.\n\n3. **No Recent Policy Changes Detected**: There are no indications of recent policy changes that would affect the SNAP EBT eligibility of Coca-Cola or similar products on Amazon. The focus has been on expanding access and increasing benefits rather than restricting eligibility.\n\n4. **Stability in SNAP Benefits**: The USDA has increased maximum allotments for SNAP benefits for the fiscal year 2025, which could enhance purchasing power but does not directly impact eligibility criteria for specific products like Coca-Cola.\n\nGiven Amazon's ongoing commitment to supporting SNAP beneficiaries and the absence of any recent policy changes that would affect the eligibility of Coca-Cola, it is likely that the product will remain listed as \"SNAP EBT eligible\" on April 1, 2025.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.9"
