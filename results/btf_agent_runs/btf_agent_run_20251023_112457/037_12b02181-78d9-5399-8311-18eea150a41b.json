  "question": "Will any rationalist, effective altruist, or AI safety researcher go on the Joe Rogan Experience before 2026?",
  "probability": 0.4,
  "reasoning": "Based on the information gathered, here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Joe Rogan's Podcast Popularity and Guest Diversity**: The Joe Rogan Experience is a highly popular podcast known for hosting a wide range of guests, including those involved in AI discussions. This increases the likelihood of hosting individuals from the rationalist, effective altruism, or AI safety communities.\n\n2. **Upcoming Guests**: The unofficial list of upcoming guests on the Joe Rogan Experience does not currently include any known rationalists, effective altruists, or AI safety researchers. However, this list is unofficial and may not be exhaustive or up-to-date.\n\n3. **Historical Context**: Joe Rogan has previously hosted guests concerned with AI safety, such as Nick Bostrom, indicating an openness to discussing such topics.\n\n4. **Timeframe**: There is still a significant amount of time (almost a year) until the end of 2025, which allows for the possibility of such a guest appearing on the podcast.\n\nGiven these considerations, while there is no immediate evidence of a scheduled appearance by a rationalist, effective altruist, or AI safety researcher, the historical openness of the podcast to such topics and the remaining time frame suggest a moderate probability.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.4",

      "content": "Based on the following question, analyze it carefully and provide your probability estimate.\n\nQuestion: Will any rationalist, effective altruist, or AI safety researcher go on the Joe Rogan Experience before 2026?\nBackground: The Joe Rogan Experience has been one of the most popular podcasts since 2015. As of December 2024, it ranks 2nd on both [Spotify](https://podcastcharts.byspotify.com/) and [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/charts). It has featured a broad variety of popular guests, such as Elon Musk, Edward Snowden, Bernie Sanders, Neil deGrasse Tyson, and Donald Trump.\n\nJoe Rogan has hosted notable figures that are bullish on AI, such as [Sam Altman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk) and [Marc Andreessen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye8MOfxD5nU), as well as individuals that are deeply concerned about the existential risk posed by AI (e.g., Nick Bostron in [Episode #1350](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5c4cv7rVlE8) and Jeremie Harris and Edouard Harris in [Episode #2156](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6JdeL90ans)).\nResolution criteria: This question will resolve as **Yes** if, after the launch of this question and before January 1, 2026, an episode of the Joe Rogan Experience is published in which one of the guests is a member of the rationality movement, a member of the effective altruism movement, or an AI safety researcher.\nFine print: * The episode has to be published - even if it is to only selected members of the podcast's audience (e.g., only those that pay a particular subscription). Trailers, teasers, or partial releases do not count.\n* A person will be considered an AI safety researcher if their primary job is or was at any point technical work in AI safety.\n* A person will be considered to be part of the rationality or effective altruism movements if they actively participate in it (by regularly posting on LessWrong or working for an EA organisation). Self-identification on its own will not resolve this question as **Yes**. In cases of ambiguity, the resolution of this question will be determined by a [resolution council](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#rescouncil) consisting of two Metaculus admins and Scott Alexander.\npresent_date: 2025-02-24T17:41:51.456731\n\n\nMake sure to use the tools at your disposal to gather relevant information before providing your final probability estimate.\n\nYou may reason through the problem, but you MUST end your response with:\nFINAL PROBABILITY: [your decimal number between 0 and 1]"

As of December 2024, it ranks 2nd on both Spotify and Apple Podcasts. It has featured a broad variety of popular guests, such as Elon Musk, Edward Snowden, Bernie Sanders, Neil deGrasse Tyson, and Donald Trump.\\n\\nJoe Rogan has hosted notable figures that are bullish on AI, such as Sam Altman and Marc Andreessen, as well as individuals that are deeply concerned about the existential risk posed by AI (e.g., Nick Bostron in Episode #1350 and Jeremie Harris and Edouard Harris in Episode #2156).\",\"resolution_criteria\":\"This question will resolve as Yes if, after the launch of this question and before January 1, 2026, an episode of the Joe Rogan Experience is published in which one of the guests is a member of the rationality movement, a member of the effective altruism movement, or an AI safety researcher.\",\"fine_print\":\"* The episode has to be published - even if it is to only selected members of the podcast's audience (e.g., only those that pay a particular subscription). Trailers, teasers, or partial releases do not count.\\n* A person will be considered an AI safety researcher if their primary job is or was at any point technical work in AI safety.\\n* A person will be considered to be part of the rationality or effective altruism movements if they actively participate in it (by regularly posting on LessWrong or working for an EA organisation). Self-identification on its own will not resolve this question as Yes. In cases of ambiguity, the resolution of this question will be determined by a resolution council consisting of two Metaculus admins and Scott Alexander.\",\"present_date\":\"2025-02-24T17:41:51.456731\"}"

      "content": "Based on the information gathered, here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Joe Rogan's Podcast Popularity and Guest Diversity**: The Joe Rogan Experience is a highly popular podcast known for hosting a wide range of guests, including those involved in AI discussions. This increases the likelihood of hosting individuals from the rationalist, effective altruism, or AI safety communities.\n\n2. **Upcoming Guests**: The unofficial list of upcoming guests on the Joe Rogan Experience does not currently include any known rationalists, effective altruists, or AI safety researchers. However, this list is unofficial and may not be exhaustive or up-to-date.\n\n3. **Historical Context**: Joe Rogan has previously hosted guests concerned with AI safety, such as Nick Bostrom, indicating an openness to discussing such topics.\n\n4. **Timeframe**: There is still a significant amount of time (almost a year) until the end of 2025, which allows for the possibility of such a guest appearing on the podcast.\n\nGiven these considerations, while there is no immediate evidence of a scheduled appearance by a rationalist, effective altruist, or AI safety researcher, the historical openness of the podcast to such topics and the remaining time frame suggest a moderate probability.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.4"
