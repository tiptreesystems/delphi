  "question": "Will Donald Trump sign fewer than 60 executive orders in February and March 2025?",
  "probability": 0.9,
  "reasoning": "Based on the extracted evidence:\n\n1. As of March 16, 2025, Donald Trump had signed a total of 92 executive orders in his second term.\n2. By February 6, 2025, Trump had already signed 58 executive orders.\n3. In February 2025, Trump signed 34 executive orders.\n4. In March 2025, up to March 14, Trump signed 15 executive orders.\n5. The total number of executive orders signed by Trump in February and March 2025 up to March 14 is 49.\n\nGiven that the question asks if Trump will sign fewer than 60 executive orders in February and March 2025, and as of March 14, 2025, he had signed 49 executive orders, it is likely that he will not exceed 60 by the end of March. The pace of signing executive orders seems to have slowed down after the initial surge in early February.\n\nTherefore, the probability that Donald Trump will sign fewer than 60 executive orders in February and March 2025 is high.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.9",

The legal or constitutional basis for executive orders has multiple sources. Article Two of the United States Constitution gives presidents broad executive and enforcement authority to use their discretion to determine how to enforce the law or to otherwise manage the resources and staff of the executive branch. The ability to make such orders is also based on expressed or implied Acts of Congress that delegate to the president some degree of discretionary power (delegated legislation).\n\nThe number of Executive Orders that presidents issue in their first months in office has been rising significantly over the past years:\n\n| President      | Period  | Number of EOs |\n| -------------- | ------- | ------------- |\n| Bill Clinton   | Q1 1993 | 9             |\n| George W. Bush | Q1 2021 | 8             |\n| Barack Obama   | Q1 2009 | 18            |\n| Donald Trump   | Q1 2017 | 23            |\n| Joe Biden      | Q1 2021 | 37            |\n\nTrump surpassed all previous records in the first 8 days in office, [having signed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_executive_orders_in_the_second_presidency_of_Donald_Trump) 58 executive orders as of February 6, 2025.\nResolution criteria: This question will resolve as YES if Donald Trump signs fewer than 60 executive orders in February and March 2025, according to [the Federal Register](https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders).\n\n##### Note that this question closes early, on March 10, 2025.\nFine print: * An Executive Order is any presidential document with an Executive Order number. Orders that do not have such a number will not count for this question.\n* If the Federal Register delays in publishing an Executive Order, Metaculus might use alternative credible sources to resolve this question, such as [the Presidential Actions archive](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/).\n* This question will resolve according to the number of Executive Orders signed by Donald Trump in February and March, 2025. The date of publication is immaterial for this question.\npresent_date: 2025-03-26T12:28:22.768467\n\n\nMake sure to use the tools at your disposal to gather relevant information before providing your final probability estimate.\n\nYou may reason through the problem, but you MUST end your response with:\nFINAL PROBABILITY: [your decimal number between 0 and 1]"

By February 6, 2025, Trump had already signed 58 executive orders.\n3. In February 2025, Trump signed 34 executive orders.\n4. In March 2025, up to March 14, Trump signed 15 executive orders.\n5. The total number of executive orders signed by Trump in February and March 2025 up to March 14 is 49.\n\nGiven that the question asks if Trump will sign fewer than 60 executive orders in February and March 2025, and as of March 14, 2025, he had signed 49 executive orders, it is likely that he will not exceed 60 by the end of March. The pace of signing executive orders seems to have slowed down after the initial surge in early February.\n\nTherefore, the probability that Donald Trump will sign fewer than 60 executive orders in February and March 2025 is high.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.9"
