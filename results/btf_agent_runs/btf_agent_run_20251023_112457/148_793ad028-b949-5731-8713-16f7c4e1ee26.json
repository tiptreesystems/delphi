  "question": "Will Tesla's total vehicle deliveries for Q1 2025 be between 400,000 and 450,000 vehicles (inclusive)?",
  "probability": 0.55,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here are the key points relevant to estimating the probability of Tesla's Q1 2025 vehicle deliveries being between 400,000 and 450,000 vehicles:\n\n1. **Analyst Consensus**: The consensus among analysts is that Tesla's Q1 2025 deliveries will be around 418,000 vehicles, which falls within the target range (400,000 to 450,000). This represents an 8.06% year-over-year improvement from Q1 2024, where Tesla delivered 386,810 vehicles.\n\n2. **Prediction Markets**: Some prediction markets, however, expect Tesla to deliver only 359,000 vehicles in Q1 2025, which is significantly below the target range and represents a 27% decrease quarter-over-quarter.\n\n3. **Impact of Protests and Vandalism**: There have been widespread protests and incidents of vandalism against Tesla vehicles and facilities, largely due to Elon Musk's political involvement. These incidents could potentially impact Tesla's sales and delivery numbers negatively.\n\n4. **Production Capacity**: Tesla's current U.S. production capacity is about 1 million vehicles per year. Elon Musk has pledged to double this capacity, but the timeline for this increase is over two years, so it may not immediately affect Q1 2025 deliveries.\n\n5. **Market Performance**: Tesla's sales in Europe are reportedly down by as much as 50% this quarter, and sales in China are slightly down year-over-year. The U.S. market's performance is uncertain but could be a deciding factor.\n\n6. **Model Y Transition**: Tesla is transitioning from the classic Model Y to a new version, which could temporarily affect delivery numbers until the new version's deliveries ramp up.\n\nConsidering the above points, there is a significant amount of uncertainty due to the mixed signals from analyst predictions and prediction markets, as well as the potential negative impact of protests and vandalism. However, the analyst consensus estimate is within the target range, which provides a basis for a moderate probability estimate.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.55",

A look at Tesla news coverage shows this, as even dedicated electric vehicle blogs and tech publications seem to find it difficult to separate Tesla from Elon Musk, who is more polarizing than ever.\n\nThis is what I aim to cover in this op-ed. I will be exploring Tesla’s first quarter vehicle deliveries, why they might be underwhelming, the reasons behind them, and why I believe the sky is not necessarily falling.\n\n**A likely miss**\n\nAnalyst consensus for Tesla’s Q1 2025 deliveries [currently stands at 418,000 vehicles](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/tesla-set-to-miss-q1-deliveries-estimate-by-a-wide-margin-barclays-3923155). That would suggest a year-over-year improvement of 8.06% from the 386,810 vehicles that Tesla was able to deliver in the first quarter of 2024. Considering Tesla’s sales in China and Europe over January and February, 418,000 deliveries seem to be a long shot for the first quarter of 2025.\n\nIt would not be surprising at all if Tesla ends up missing Wall Street’s consensus estimates, and by a pretty wide margin. Such is expected considering Tesla’s focus in the first quarter. But what is this focus, really? Elon Musk’s politics? Not necessarily.\n\n**A Model Y-shaped hole**\n\nCritics and negative Tesla news coverage would argue that the company’s steep drop in sales in several European markets and China is a sign that the company is finished, or that Elon Musk is doing global damage to the Tesla brand. However, Tesla’s sales decline this Q1 may actually be affected in no small part by the company’s transition from the Model Y classic to the new Model Y, which was launched across the United States, China, and Germany.\n\nThe Model Y is Tesla’s strongest sel…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 378 words out of ~2179.

We have to go back to 2022 to see the delivery volume the automaker is expected to deliver.\n\nTime to worry for Tesla shareholders?\n\nPrediction markets are entering the game of setting expectations for Tesla’s quarterly deliveries.\n\nThese markets use financial incentives, similar to betting, to predict specific outcomes. They became extremely popular during the latest US elections and have since expanded to predict a lot more outcomes ranging from sports to business to virtually anything.\n\nKalshi, one of the biggest prediction markets, has been running markets to predict Tesla’s quarterly deliveries that already gathered half a million in volumes.\n\nIt currently predicts that Tesla will deliver 359,000 vehicles in Q1 2025:\n\nThis would be down 7% year-over-year and a massive 27% down quarter-over-quarter.\n\nIn fact, you have to go back more than two years, Q3 2022, to get a quarter when Tesla delivered fewer vehicles than what is expected this quarter:\n\nAs we previously reported, Tesla’s sales are crashing in Europe this quarter – down by as much as 50%.\n\nIn China, Tesla’s most important market, sales are down slightly year-over-year.\n\nThe US is the most opaque market, and it will be the difference maker this quarter.\n\n## Electrek’s Take\n\n## Top comment by [Andrea](https://electrek.co#comments)\n\n**The Model Y changeover cannot last forever**, and there are many deadlines coming up in 2025 for Tesla, from the Robotaxi to a more affordable Tesla model, from the \"thousands\" Optimus that are due to perform tasks in Tesla's factories by the end of this year, to the unsupervised self-driving software available as a paid service in select markets starting in June.\n\nIt's not a matter of if, but of when the chickens will come home to roost.\n\n[View all comments](https://electrek.co#comments)\n\nThis quarter would finally be the time to prove to Tesla shareholders that Elon is bad for Tesla.

Doors and windows at once pristine luxury electric vehicle showrooms are now scrawled with profanity and Nazi symbols.\n\nTeslas, once the darling of alternative energy advocates, are now the unlikely target of political violence. Experts say while the singling out of individual vehicles is unusual, activists focusing ire on a corporation has a long history in America.\n\nNo one has been seriously hurt in the incidents, but they have heightened alarm from both law enforcement officials and experts in political extremism about where this is heading.\n\n“We have a continuum of activity, some of which we rightfully tolerate, such as boisterous and passionate protests,” said Brian Levin, a professor emeritus at Cal State San Bernardino and an expert on extremism. “But now we’re getting to another level of this kind of directed arson and violence, which, to be sure, has an intimidation effect.”\n\nWith Chief Executive Elon Musk playing a prominent role in the Trump administration, many Tesla drivers are no longer happy about supporting the car brand.\n\nThe Tesla attacks have been scattered and do not appear to be coordinated. But the one thing they seem to have in common is disdain for Tesla owner Elon Musk and his efforts to fire federal workers and shrink the size of government.\n\nAfter Las Vegas was hit with a spate of Tesla attacks, Spencer Evans, FBI special agent in charge of the Las Vegas bureau, issued a warning to would-be political vandals.\n\n“Specifically to those who might think that something like this is justifiable or potentially even admirable, we want to let you know it’s a federal crime,” he sa…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 382 words out of ~1956.

Considering that Tesla’s Fremont Factory is already fully optimized, however, Musk may be looking to expand Tesla’s production using the Gigafactory Texas complex.\n\n**Lofty Goals**\n\nTesla’s current U.S. production capacity stands at just about 1 million vehicles per year. As per Tesla’s [Q4 and FY 2024 Update Letter](https://digitalassets.tesla.com/tesla-contents/image/upload/IR/TSLA-Q4-2024-Update.pdf), the Fremont Factory currently has a capacity of over 650,000 vehicles per year, while Giga Texas currently has a production capacity of 375,000 vehicles annually.\n\nIf Tesla would like to hit 2 million vehicles annually from its U.S. factories, it would have to significantly increase the output of Giga Texas. Tesla could accomplish this with the Cybercab, as per Elon Musk last October.\n\n**Elon Musk’s Prediction**\n\nDuring the Q3 2024 earnings call, Musk predicted that Tesla would reach volume production of the Cybercab in 2026.

A look at Tesla news coverage shows this, as even dedicated electric vehicle blogs and tech publications seem to find it difficult to separate Tesla from Elon Musk, who is more polarizing than ever.\n\nThis is what I aim to cover in this op-ed. I will be exploring Tesla’s first quarter vehicle deliveries, why they might be underwhelming, the reasons behind them, and why I believe the sky is not necessarily falling.\n\n**A likely miss**\n\nAnalyst consensus for Tesla’s Q1 2025 deliveries [currently stands at 418,000 vehicles](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/tesla-set-to-miss-q1-deliveries-estimate-by-a-wide-margin-barclays-3923155). That would suggest a year-over-year improvement of 8.06% from the 386,810 vehicles that Tesla was able to deliver in the first quarter of 2024. Considering Tesla’s sales in China and Europe over January and February, 418,000 deliveries seem to be a long shot for the first quarter of 2025.\n\nIt would not be surprising at all if Tesla ends up missing Wall Street’s consensus estimates, and by a pretty wide margin. Such is expected considering Tesla’s focus in the first quarter. But what is this focus, really? Elon Musk’s politics? Not necessarily.\n\n**A Model Y-shaped hole**\n\nCritics and negative Tesla news coverage would argue that the company’s steep drop in sales in several European markets and China is a sign that the company is finished, or that Elon Musk is doing global damage to the Tesla brand. However, Tesla’s sales decline this Q1 may actually be affected in no small part by the company’s transition from the Model Y classic to the new Model Y, which was launched across the United States, China, and Germany.\n\nThe Model Y is Tesla’s strongest sel…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 378 words out of ~2179.

A look at Tesla news coverage shows this, as even dedicated electric vehicle blogs and tech publications seem to find it difficult to separate Tesla from Elon Musk, who is more polarizing than ever.\\n\\nThis is what I aim to cover in this op-ed. I will be exploring Tesla\\u2019s first quarter vehicle deliveries, why they might be underwhelming, the reasons behind them, and why I believe the sky is not necessarily falling.\\n\\n**A likely miss**\\n\\nAnalyst consensus for Tesla\\u2019s Q1 2025 deliveries [currently stands at 418,000 vehicles](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/tesla-set-to-miss-q1-deliveries-estimate-by-a-wide-margin-barclays-3923155). That would suggest a year-over-year improvement of 8.06% from the 386,810 vehicles that Tesla was able to deliver in the first quarter of 2024. Considering Tesla\\u2019s sales in China and Europe over January and February, 418,000 deliveries seem to be a long shot for the first quarter of 2025.\\n\\nIt would not be surprising at all if Tesla ends up missing Wall Street\\u2019s consensus estimates, and by a pretty wide margin. Such is expected considering Tesla\\u2019s focus in the first quarter. But what is this focus, really? Elon Musk\\u2019s politics? Not necessarily.\\n\\n**A Model Y-shaped hole**\\n\\nCritics and negative Tesla news coverage would argue that the company\\u2019s steep drop in sales in several European markets and China is a sign that the company is finished, or that Elon Musk is doing global damage to the Tesla brand. However, Tesla\\u2019s sales decline this Q1 may actually be affected in no small part by the company\\u2019s transition from the Model Y classic to the new Model Y, which was launched across the United States, China, and Germany.\\n\\nThe Model Y is Tesla\\u2019s strongest sel\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 378 words out of ~2179.

Considering that Tesla’s Fremont Factory is already fully optimized, however, Musk may be looking to expand Tesla’s production using the Gigafactory Texas complex.\n\n**Lofty Goals**\n\nTesla’s current U.S. production capacity stands at just about 1 million vehicles per year. As per Tesla’s [Q4 and FY 2024 Update Letter](https://digitalassets.tesla.com/tesla-contents/image/upload/IR/TSLA-Q4-2024-Update.pdf), the Fremont Factory currently has a capacity of over 650,000 vehicles per year, while Giga Texas currently has a production capacity of 375,000 vehicles annually.\n\nIf Tesla would like to hit 2 million vehicles annually from its U.S. factories, it would have to significantly increase the output of Giga Texas. Tesla could accomplish this with the Cybercab, as per Elon Musk last October.\n\n**Elon Musk’s Prediction**\n\nDuring the Q3 2024 earnings call, Musk predicted that Tesla would reach volume production of the Cybercab in 2026. At the time, Musk explained that Tesla is [aiming to produce at least 2 million Cybercabs per year](htt…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 342 words out of ~1514.

Considering that Tesla\\u2019s Fremont Factory is already fully optimized, however, Musk may be looking to expand Tesla\\u2019s production using the Gigafactory Texas complex.\\n\\n**Lofty Goals**\\n\\nTesla\\u2019s current U.S. production capacity stands at just about 1 million vehicles per year. As per Tesla\\u2019s [Q4 and FY 2024 Update Letter](https://digitalassets.tesla.com/tesla-contents/image/upload/IR/TSLA-Q4-2024-Update.pdf), the Fremont Factory currently has a capacity of over 650,000 vehicles per year, while Giga Texas currently has a production capacity of 375,000 vehicles annually.\\n\\nIf Tesla would like to hit 2 million vehicles annually from its U.S. factories, it would have to significantly increase the output of Giga Texas. Tesla could accomplish this with the Cybercab, as per Elon Musk last October.\\n\\n**Elon Musk\\u2019s Prediction**\\n\\nDuring the Q3 2024 earnings call, Musk predicted that Tesla would reach volume production of the Cybercab in 2026. At the time, Musk explained that Tesla is [aiming to produce at least 2 million Cybercabs per year](htt\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 342 words out of ~1514.

A look at Tesla news coverage shows this, as even dedicated electric vehicle blogs and tech publications seem to find it difficult to separate Tesla from Elon Musk, who is more polarizing than ever.\\n\\nThis is what I aim to cover in this op-ed. I will be exploring Tesla\\u2019s first quarter vehicle deliveries, why they might be underwhelming, the reasons behind them, and why I believe the sky is not necessarily falling.\\n\\n**A likely miss**\\n\\nAnalyst consensus for Tesla\\u2019s Q1 2025 deliveries [currently stands at 418,000 vehicles](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/tesla-set-to-miss-q1-deliveries-estimate-by-a-wide-margin-barclays-3923155). That would suggest a year-over-year improvement of 8.06% from the 386,810 vehicles that Tesla was able to deliver in the first quarter of 2024. Considering Tesla\\u2019s sales in China and Europe over January and February, 418,000 deliveries seem to be a long shot for the first quarter of 2025.\\n\\nIt would not be surprising at all if Tesla ends up missing Wall Street\\u2019s consensus estimates, and by a pretty wide margin. Such is expected considering Tesla\\u2019s focus in the first quarter. But what is this focus, really? Elon Musk\\u2019s politics? Not necessarily.\\n\\n**A Model Y-shaped hole**\\n\\nCritics and negative Tesla news coverage would argue that the company\\u2019s steep drop in sales in several European markets and China is a sign that the company is finished, or that Elon Musk is doing global damage to the Tesla brand. However, Tesla\\u2019s sales decline this Q1 may actually be affected in no small part by the company\\u2019s transition from the Model Y classic to the new Model Y, which was launched across the United States, China, and Germany.\\n\\nThe Model Y is Tesla\\u2019s strongest sel\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 378 words out of ~2179.

      "content": "Based on the gathered evidence, here are the key points relevant to estimating the probability of Tesla's Q1 2025 vehicle deliveries being between 400,000 and 450,000 vehicles:\n\n1. **Analyst Consensus**: The consensus among analysts is that Tesla's Q1 2025 deliveries will be around 418,000 vehicles, which falls within the target range (400,000 to 450,000). This represents an 8.06% year-over-year improvement from Q1 2024, where Tesla delivered 386,810 vehicles.\n\n2. **Prediction Markets**: Some prediction markets, however, expect Tesla to deliver only 359,000 vehicles in Q1 2025, which is significantly below the target range and represents a 27% decrease quarter-over-quarter.\n\n3. **Impact of Protests and Vandalism**: There have been widespread protests and incidents of vandalism against Tesla vehicles and facilities, largely due to Elon Musk's political involvement. These incidents could potentially impact Tesla's sales and delivery numbers negatively.\n\n4. **Production Capacity**: Tesla's current U.S. production capacity is about 1 million vehicles per year. Elon Musk has pledged to double this capacity, but the timeline for this increase is over two years, so it may not immediately affect Q1 2025 deliveries.\n\n5. **Market Performance**: Tesla's sales in Europe are reportedly down by as much as 50% this quarter, and sales in China are slightly down year-over-year. The U.S. market's performance is uncertain but could be a deciding factor.\n\n6. **Model Y Transition**: Tesla is transitioning from the classic Model Y to a new version, which could temporarily affect delivery numbers until the new version's deliveries ramp up.\n\nConsidering the above points, there is a significant amount of uncertainty due to the mixed signals from analyst predictions and prediction markets, as well as the potential negative impact of protests and vandalism. However, the analyst consensus estimate is within the target range, which provides a basis for a moderate probability estimate.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.55"
