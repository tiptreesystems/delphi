  "question": "Will Life is Strange: Double Exposure win the 2025 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Video Game?",
  "probability": 0.05,
  "reasoning": "Based on the search results, here's what I found:\n\n1. **Nomination Status**: \"Life is Strange: Double Exposure\" is not mentioned as a nominee for the 36th Annual GLAAD Media Awards for Outstanding Video Game. The official GLAAD Media Awards nominee list does not include this game.\n\n2. **LGBT Representation**: The game has been reviewed as having significant LGBTQ representation. It is described as a queer story at heart, with explicit LGBT inclusion, which aligns with the criteria for the GLAAD Media Awards. However, some reviews suggest that while it is inclusive, it may not have been as impactful or well-received as previous entries in the series.\n\n3. **Predictions and Public Perception**: There are no specific predictions or mentions of \"Life is Strange: Double Exposure\" being a strong contender for the award. The general sentiment from reviews indicates mixed feelings about the game's impact and quality.\n\nGiven the lack of nomination and the mixed reviews regarding its impact and representation, the probability of \"Life is Strange: Double Exposure\" winning the 2025 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Video Game is quite low.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.05",

However, some reviews suggest that while it is inclusive, it may not have been as impactful or well-received as previous entries in the series.\n\n3. **Predictions and Public Perception**: There are no specific predictions or mentions of \"Life is Strange: Double Exposure\" being a strong contender for the award. The general sentiment from reviews indicates mixed feelings about the game's impact and quality.\n\nGiven the lack of nomination and the mixed reviews regarding its impact and representation, the probability of \"Life is Strange: Double Exposure\" winning the 2025 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Video Game is quite low.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.05"
