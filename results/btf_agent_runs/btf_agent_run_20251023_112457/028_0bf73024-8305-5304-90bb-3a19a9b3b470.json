  "question": "Will the Trump administration impose new tariffs on the EU before April 7, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.65,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here are the key points regarding the potential imposition of new tariffs by the Trump administration on the EU before April 7, 2025:\n\n1. **Reinstatement of Section 232 Tariffs**: The Trump administration has reinstated a 25% tariff on steel imports and increased tariffs on aluminum imports to 25%, which affects the EU. This action is part of a broader strategy to close loopholes and exemptions that previously allowed certain countries, including the EU, to avoid these tariffs. The administration justifies these tariffs as necessary to protect national security and counter unfair trade practices.\n\n2. **EU's Response and Negotiations**: The European Union has expressed a strong stance against the proposed tariffs, labeling them as unjustified. The EU trade chief, Maros Sefcovic, has indicated a willingness to negotiate with the U.S. to avoid economic pain from unilateral tariffs and EU countermeasures. There is an ongoing dialogue with the U.S. to potentially reduce tariffs mutually, and the EU is interested in increasing purchases of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) as part of trade negotiations.\n\n3. **Reciprocal Trade Policy**: President Trump has tasked his economics team with devising plans for tariffs on countries that impose tariffs on U.S. imports, including the EU. The EU maintains that over 70% of imports enter the bloc tariff-free and sees no justification for increased U.S. tariffs on its exports. The EU has vowed to react firmly and immediately against any unjustified barriers to free and fair trade.\n\n4. **Timing and Decision**: Trump's memorandum left the decision on new tariffs until after a series of reports due by April 1 on the U.S. goods trade deficit and practices of trading partners. This indicates that while tariffs have been announced, their implementation may depend on the outcomes of these reports and ongoing negotiations.\n\nGiven these points, there is a significant possibility that new tariffs could be imposed, especially considering the aggressive stance of the Trump administration on trade issues. However, the ongoing negotiations and the EU's firm response could potentially delay or alter the implementation of these tariffs.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.65",

Trump signed proclamations to close existing loopholes and exemptions to restore a true 25% tariff on steel and elevate the tariff to 25% on aluminum.\n\n- President Trump is taking action to protect America’s critical steel and aluminum industries, which have been harmed by unfair trade practices and global excess capacity.\n\n- President Trump is reinstating the full 25% tariff on steel imports and increasing tariffs on aluminum imports to 25%.\n- Key reforms include eliminating all alternative agreements, applying strict “melted and poured” standards, expanding tariffs to include key downstream products, terminating all general approved exclusions, and cracking down on tariff misclassification and duty evasion schemes.\n\n- The countries of Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, the European Union, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom had received exemptions, which prevented the tariffs from being effective.\n- By granting exemptions to certain countries, the United States inadvertently created loopholes that were exploited by China and others with excess steel and aluminum capacity, undermining the purpose of these exemptions.\n\n- The President is exercising his authority under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to adjust imports of steel and aluminum to protect our national security.\n- This statute provides the President with authority to adjust imports being brought into the United States in quantities or under circumstances that threaten to impair national security.\n\n- In March 2018, President Trump invoked authority under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. § 1862) to impose 25% tariffs on steel imports and 10% tariffs on aluminum. These measures were remarkably effective in supporting recovery and reinvestment in the American steel industry and saved the domestic primary aluminum industry…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 351 words out of ~1027.

      "content": "Based on the following question, analyze it carefully and provide your probability estimate.\n\nQuestion: Will the Trump administration impose new tariffs on the EU before April 7, 2025?\nBackground: The new US administration under President Donald J. Trump is aggressively using new tariffs to achieve its policy goals. In the first month of his presidency, the Trump administration [imposed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-imposes-tariffs-on-imports-from-canada-mexico-and-china/) a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, which were both [postponed](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87d5rlee52o) after agreeing upon new border security measures. An additional [10% tariff](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-imposes-tariffs-on-imports-from-canada-mexico-and-china/) was also introduced on imports from China.\n\nTrump has already [threatened](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4zgx808g7o) the EU with tariffs at the beginning of February 2025, mostly because of the fact that currently, the EU imposes a [10% tariff](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/bmw-ceo-proposes-cutting-eu-tariff-us-vehicle-imports-25-2025-01-28/) on US cars imported to the bloc, while the US imposes a 2.5% tariff on the EU automotive industry, making US carmakers less competitive in the European markets. The EU also maintains [higher tariffs](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/transatlantic-trade-tensions-looming-us-eu-showdown) than the US on some agricultural products, such as beef and pork.\n\nIn 2018, the US [imposed](https://policy.trade.ec.europa.eu/eu-trade-relationships-country-and-region/countries-and-regions/united-states_en) tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum imports from the EU under Section 232 of the [Trade Expansion Act](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-76/pdf/STATUTE-76-Pg872.pdf), citing national security concerns. These tariffs [were lifted](https://www.piie.com/blogs/trade-and-investment-policy-watch/2021/biden-and-europe-remove-trumps-steel-and-aluminum) under the Biden administration, but on February 12 they [were reannounced](https://www.reuters.com/markets/eu-should-negotiate-avert-trade-war-germany-says-bloc-ministers-meet-2025-02-12/) by the Trump administration to be imposed from March 12, 2025.\nResolution criteria: This question will resolve as **Yes** if any new US tariffs targeting the EU take effect and stay in effect for at least seven days before April 7, 2025, according to official [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/news/) or EU press releases, or other [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\nFine print: * Any tariff that was not in effect on February 14, 2025 counts.\n* The whole EU has to be targeted by tariffs. If at least one EU member state is not included, this question will *not* resolve as **Yes**.\n* The tariff rate or tariff scope (i.e. which industries are being targetted) is immaterial to the question resolution. If tariffs are postponed after they took effect or canceled after being in effect (even for a short time), the question will still resolve positively.\n* The tariffs have to be in effect for a total of seven days. If they come into effect, are paused, and then resume, the total number of days will be used to resolve this question.\npresent_date: 2025-02-23T19:59:16.201885\n\n\nMake sure to use the tools at your disposal to gather relevant information before providing your final probability estimate.\n\nYou may reason through the problem, but you MUST end your response with:\nFINAL PROBABILITY: [your decimal number between 0 and 1]"

      "content": "Based on the gathered evidence, here are the key points regarding the potential imposition of new tariffs by the Trump administration on the EU before April 7, 2025:\n\n1. **Reinstatement of Section 232 Tariffs**: The Trump administration has reinstated a 25% tariff on steel imports and increased tariffs on aluminum imports to 25%, which affects the EU. This action is part of a broader strategy to close loopholes and exemptions that previously allowed certain countries, including the EU, to avoid these tariffs. The administration justifies these tariffs as necessary to protect national security and counter unfair trade practices.\n\n2. **EU's Response and Negotiations**: The European Union has expressed a strong stance against the proposed tariffs, labeling them as unjustified. The EU trade chief, Maros Sefcovic, has indicated a willingness to negotiate with the U.S. to avoid economic pain from unilateral tariffs and EU countermeasures. There is an ongoing dialogue with the U.S. to potentially reduce tariffs mutually, and the EU is interested in increasing purchases of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) as part of trade negotiations.\n\n3. **Reciprocal Trade Policy**: President Trump has tasked his economics team with devising plans for tariffs on countries that impose tariffs on U.S. imports, including the EU. The EU maintains that over 70% of imports enter the bloc tariff-free and sees no justification for increased U.S. tariffs on its exports. The EU has vowed to react firmly and immediately against any unjustified barriers to free and fair trade.\n\n4. **Timing and Decision**: Trump's memorandum left the decision on new tariffs until after a series of reports due by April 1 on the U.S. goods trade deficit and practices of trading partners. This indicates that while tariffs have been announced, their implementation may depend on the outcomes of these reports and ongoing negotiations.\n\nGiven these points, there is a significant possibility that new tariffs could be imposed, especially considering the aggressive stance of the Trump administration on trade issues. However, the ongoing negotiations and the EU's firm response could potentially delay or alter the implementation of these tariffs.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.65"
