  "question": "Will the lowest price of bitcoin fall between $65,000 and $75,000 (inclusive) during the rest of March 2025?",
  "probability": 0.1,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered information:\n\n1. **Current Bitcoin Price**: As of March 22, 2025, Bitcoin was trading at approximately $84,377 according to Trading Economics. This price is above the target range of $65,000 to $75,000.\n\n2. **Price Predictions**: \n   - Changelly's forecast indicated a price of $93,404.84 by March 22, 2025, suggesting a bullish trend.\n   - CoinLore's analysis showed a current price of $84,021 with a bearish short-term sentiment, but still above the target range.\n   - The general sentiment from these sources is that Bitcoin is expected to remain above the $75,000 mark in the near term.\n\n3. **Market Sentiment**: The market sentiment is mixed, with some bearish indicators, but the overall price predictions and current levels suggest that Bitcoin is unlikely to drop into the $65,000 to $75,000 range within the remaining days of March 2025.\n\nGiven the current price levels and the forecasts, the probability that the lowest price of Bitcoin will fall between $65,000 and $75,000 during the rest of March 2025 is low.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1",
