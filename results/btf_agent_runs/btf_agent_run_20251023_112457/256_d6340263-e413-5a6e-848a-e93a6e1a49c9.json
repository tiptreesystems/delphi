  "question": "Will Donald Trump's net worth, according to Forbes, be in the range of $0 to $6 billion, inclusive, on March 31, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.9,
  "reasoning": "Based on the information gathered:\n\n1. As of March 11, 2025, Forbes estimates Donald Trump's net worth at $4.5 billion.\n2. Trump's net worth decreased from roughly $6 billion to $4.5 billion between January 1 and March 11, 2025.\n3. High interest rates in the United States have negatively impacted the real estate market, a significant component of Trump's wealth.\n4. Trump Media & Technology Group's value has dropped significantly, affecting Trump's stake in the company.\n5. Trump has been ordered to pay $454 million due to legal issues, impacting his financial situation.\n\nGiven these facts, Donald Trump's net worth is currently estimated at $4.5 billion, which is within the range of $0 to $6 billion. There are no indications of significant positive changes expected before March 31, 2025, that could push his net worth above $6 billion. Therefore, it is highly likely that his net worth will remain within the specified range by the resolution date.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.9",
