  "question": "Will Kalshi rank 51st or lower in the iPhone Top Free Finance Apps on March 31, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.8,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here are the key points regarding Kalshi's ranking in the iPhone Top Free Finance Apps:\n\n1. **Current Ranking**: Kalshi is not listed in the top 50 of the iPhone Top Free Finance Apps as of March 24, 2025. This suggests that it is currently ranked 51st or lower.\n\n2. **Competitive Landscape**: The top finance apps include major players like Intuit Credit Karma, Cash App, PayPal, and Venmo, which are well-established and popular. This indicates strong competition in the finance category.\n\n3. **Recent Performance**: The CEO of Kalshi tweeted about being back in the top 10, suggesting recent fluctuations in their app ranking. However, the current absence from the top 50 indicates a decline since that tweet.\n\n4. **Ranking Volatility**: App rankings are updated every hour, meaning they can change frequently based on user downloads and engagement.\n\nGiven these points, it seems likely that Kalshi will remain 51st or lower by March 31, 2025, unless there is a significant increase in user engagement or downloads in the next few days.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.8",

This suggests that it is currently ranked 51st or lower.\n\n2. **Competitive Landscape**: The top finance apps include major players like Intuit Credit Karma, Cash App, PayPal, and Venmo, which are well-established and popular. This indicates strong competition in the finance category.\n\n3. **Recent Performance**: The CEO of Kalshi tweeted about being back in the top 10, suggesting recent fluctuations in their app ranking. However, the current absence from the top 50 indicates a decline since that tweet.\n\n4. **Ranking Volatility**: App rankings are updated every hour, meaning they can change frequently based on user downloads and engagement.\n\nGiven these points, it seems likely that Kalshi will remain 51st or lower by March 31, 2025, unless there is a significant increase in user engagement or downloads in the next few days.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.8"
