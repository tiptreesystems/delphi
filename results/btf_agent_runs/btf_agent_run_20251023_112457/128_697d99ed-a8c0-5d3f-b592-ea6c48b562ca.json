  "probability": 0.85,
  "reasoning": "Based on the search results:\n\n1. **Russian Personnel Losses**: As of March 9, 2025, Russian military personnel losses in Ukraine are approximately 885,130 people, with an increase of 1,180 reported for that day. This indicates that the losses are continuing to accumulate at a significant rate, although slightly below the 1,300 daily rate mentioned in the background.\n\n2. **Ceasefire or Peace Talks**: There are no recent reports or indications of a ceasefire or peace talks that might affect the reporting of casualties before March 21, 2025.\n\nGiven the current rate of casualties and the absence of any ceasefire or peace agreement, it is likely that the 900,000 threshold will be reached before March 21, 2025. The daily increase, although slightly below 1,300, is still substantial enough to suggest that the target will be met within the remaining days.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.85",

At the same time the daily rate is being constantly above 1000 since July 25, 2024. With the pace of 1300 casualties per day the number of 900,000 casualties should be reached on March 20, 2025.\n\nHistorical data can be tracked by independent trackers\nsuch as [russian-casualties-in-ua](https://russian-casualties.in.ua/) , [Combat.FYI](https://combat.fyi/) and in the [2022-Ukraine-Russia-War-Dataset](https://github.com/PetroIvaniuk/2022-Ukraine-Russia-War-Dataset/blob/main/data/russia_losses_personnel.json).\nResolution criteria: This question will resolve as **Yes** if, before March 21, 2025, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reports 900,000 or more total Russian personnel losses on their [official site](https://mod.gov.ua/en/news?tags=Combat) or public media pages ([Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/GeneralStaff.ua), [Telegram](https://t.me/GeneralStaffZSU), [X.com](https://x.com/GeneralStaffUA)).\n\nIf all reports published before March 21, 2025 show numbers below 900,000, this question resolves as **No**. This includes the case when the General Staff of the AFU stops publishing their data due to a ceasefire or peace agreement.\nFine print: * \"Personnel losses\" in this context are *killed and wounded* soldiers and that wounded soldiers may return to the battlefield later.\n* In the past there was at least one occasion on [May 27, 2023](https://www.facebook.com/GeneralStaff.ua/posts/594141432898939?ref=embed_post) when the error in the previous day's report was admitted and corrected. For this reason, the question will resolve two days later than any published report, although it will retroactively close before the date the report was first published.\n* Historical trackers mentioned in the Background information ([russian-casualties-in-ua](https://russian-casualties.in.ua/), [Combat.FYI](https://combat.fyi/) and the [2022-Ukraine-Russia-War-Dataset](https://github.com/PetroIvaniuk/2022-Ukraine-Russia-War-Dataset/blob/main/data/russia_losses_personnel.json)) may be used as secondary resolution sources if the main resolution pages are banned/unavailable.\npresent_date: 2025-03-11T11:22:15.102664\n\n\nMake sure to use the tools at your disposal to gather relevant information before providing your final probability estimate.\n\nYou may reason through the problem, but you MUST end your response with:\nFINAL PROBABILITY: [your decimal number between 0 and 1]"
