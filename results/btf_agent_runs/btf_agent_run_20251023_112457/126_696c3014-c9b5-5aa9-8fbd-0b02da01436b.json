  "question": "Will the USDA-posted recall by Yu Shang Food, Inc. of Ready-To-Eat Meat and Poultry Products issued November 21, 2024 be closed before March 1, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.3,
  "reasoning": "Based on the search results, I was unable to find specific updates on the status of the Yu Shang Food Inc. recall as of February 2025. Additionally, there were no direct announcements from the USDA FSIS regarding the closure of this particular recall. Information about the average duration of USDA FSIS recalls for Listeria was also not available in the search results.\n\nGiven the lack of specific information indicating that the recall has been closed, and considering that recalls involving Listeria can sometimes take longer due to the severity and potential health impacts, it is reasonable to estimate a lower probability for the recall being closed by March 1, 2025.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.3",
