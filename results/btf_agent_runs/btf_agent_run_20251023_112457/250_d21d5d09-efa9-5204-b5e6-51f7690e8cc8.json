  "question": "Will the number of active US drilling rigs be 595 to 599 on March 28, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.2,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here are the key points relevant to the probability estimation:\n\n1. **Current Rig Count**: As of March 14, 2025, the total number of active US drilling rigs is 592. The rig count has remained stable at 592 for two consecutive weeks.\n\n2. **Recent Trends**: The rig count showed minor fluctuations in February 2025, with a slight increase to 593 on February 28, 2025, before stabilizing at 592.\n\n3. **Oil Market Conditions**: Oil prices have declined by about $7/bbl in February and early March 2025, with Brent futures trading near three-year lows around $70/bbl. This decline in oil prices could reduce the economic incentives for increasing drilling activity.\n\n4. **Global Oil Supply**: Global oil supply rose by 240 kb/d in February 2025, and OPEC+ plans to start unwinding voluntary production cuts in April 2025. This could lead to increased global oil supply and further pressure on prices.\n\n5. **US Production Outlook**: The United States is currently producing at record highs and is forecast to be the largest source of supply growth in 2025. This suggests a potential increase in drilling activity, although the current rig count does not reflect this yet.\n\n6. **Policy Developments**: President Donald Trump signed a resolution that could impact offshore energy development, which may influence future drilling activity.\n\nGiven the current rig count of 592 and the stable trend observed, it seems unlikely that the rig count will increase to fall within the 595 to 599 range by March 28, 2025, especially considering the downward pressure on oil prices and the recent stability in rig counts.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.2",

A report by the International Energy Agency.\nsitename: IEA\ndate: 2025-03-13\n---\n#### About this report\n\nThe IEA Oil Market Report (OMR) is one of the world's most authoritative and timely sources of data, forecasts and analysis on the global oil market – including detailed statistics and commentary on oil supply, demand, inventories, prices and refining activity, as well as oil trade for IEA and selected non-IEA countries.\n\n#### Highlights\n\n- Growth in global oil demand is set to accelerate to just over 1 mb/d this year, from 830 kb/d in 2024, reaching 103.9 mb/d. Asia accounts for almost 60% of gains, led by China where petrochemical feedstocks will provide the entirety of growth. Amid an unusually uncertain macroeconomic climate, recent delivery data have been below expectations, leading to slightly lower estimates for 4Q24 and 1Q25 growth at 1.2 mb/d y-o-y.\n- World oil supply rose by 240 kb/d in February to 103.3 mb/d, led by OPEC+. Kazakhstan pumped at an all-time high as Tengiz ramped up, while Iran and Venezuela boosted flows ahead of tighter sanctions. Non-OPEC+ production is set to rise by 1.5 mb/d in 2025, led by the Americas. Following a 770 kb/d output decline last year, OPEC+ output could hold steady in 2025 if voluntary cuts are maintained after April.\n- Global crude runs dropped by 570 kb/d m-o-m to 82.8 mb/d in February, extending their decline from December’s five-year high of 84.3 mb/d, on planned and unplanned outages. Throughputs are forecast to average 83.3 mb/d in 2025, up 570 kb/d y-o-y as lower OECD activity partly offsets a 930 kb/d annual increase in the non-OECD. Refining margins recovered in February, as falling crude prices lifted profitability in all regions.\n- Global observed oil stocks fell by 40.5 mb in January, of which 26.1 mb were products. Non‑OECD crude stocks plunged by 45.3 mb, dominated by China where imports declined. Total OECD stocks rose by 11.2 mb, boosted by a 25 mb build in industry crude inventories. Oil on water fell by 6.7 mb. However, preliminary data for February show total global oil stocks rebounded, lifted by an increase in oil on water.\n- Oil prices declined by about $7/bbl in February and early March as macro sentiment soured amid escalating trade tensions, clouding the outlook for oil demand…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 411 words out of ~1344.

A report by the International Energy Agency.\nsitename: IEA\ndate: 2025-03-13\n---\n#### About this report\n\nThe IEA Oil Market Report (OMR) is one of the world's most authoritative and timely sources of data, forecasts and analysis on the global oil market – including detailed statistics and commentary on oil supply, demand, inventories, prices and refining activity, as well as oil trade for IEA and selected non-IEA countries.\n\n#### Highlights\n\n- Growth in global oil demand is set to accelerate to just over 1 mb/d this year, from 830 kb/d in 2024, reaching 103.9 mb/d. Asia accounts for almost 60% of gains, led by China where petrochemical feedstocks will provide the entirety of growth. Amid an unusually uncertain macroeconomic climate, recent delivery data have been below expectations, leading to slightly lower estimates for 4Q24 and 1Q25 growth at 1.2 mb/d y-o-y.\n- World oil supply rose by 240 kb/d in February to 103.3 mb/d, led by OPEC+. Kazakhstan pumped at an all-time high as Tengiz ramped up, while Iran and Venezuela boosted flows ahead of tighter sanctions. Non-OPEC+ production is set to rise by 1.5 mb/d in 2025, led by the Americas. Following a 770 kb/d output decline last year, OPEC+ output could hold steady in 2025 if voluntary cuts are maintained after April.\n- Global crude runs dropped by 570 kb/d m-o-m to 82.8 mb/d in February, extending their decline from December’s five-year high of 84.3 mb/d, on planned and unplanned outages. Throughputs are forecast to average 83.3 mb/d in 2025, up 570 kb/d y-o-y as lower OECD activity partly offsets a 930 kb/d annual increase in the non-OECD. Refining margins recovered in February, as falling crude prices lifted profitability in all regions.\n- Global observed oil stocks fell by 40.5 mb in January, of which 26.1 mb were products. Non‑OECD crude stocks plunged by 45.3 mb, dominated by China where imports declined. Total OECD stocks rose by 11.2 mb, boosted by a 25 mb build in industry crude inventories. Oil on water fell by 6.7 mb. However, preliminary data for February show total global oil stocks rebounded, lifted by an increase in oil on water.\n- Oil prices declined by about $7/bbl in February and early March as macro sentiment soured amid escalating trade tensions, clouding the outlook for oil demand…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 411 words out of ~1344.

A report by the International Energy Agency.\\nsitename: IEA\\ndate: 2025-03-13\\n---\\n#### About this report\\n\\nThe IEA Oil Market Report (OMR) is one of the world's most authoritative and timely sources of data, forecasts and analysis on the global oil market \\u2013 including detailed statistics and commentary on oil supply, demand, inventories, prices and refining activity, as well as oil trade for IEA and selected non-IEA countries.\\n\\n#### Highlights\\n\\n- Growth in global oil demand is set to accelerate to just over 1 mb/d this year, from 830 kb/d in 2024, reaching 103.9 mb/d. Asia accounts for almost 60% of gains, led by China where petrochemical feedstocks will provide the entirety of growth. Amid an unusually uncertain macroeconomic climate, recent delivery data have been below expectations, leading to slightly lower estimates for 4Q24 and 1Q25 growth at 1.2 mb/d y-o-y.\\n- World oil supply rose by 240 kb/d in February to 103.3 mb/d, led by OPEC+. Kazakhstan pumped at an all-time high as Tengiz ramped up, while Iran and Venezuela boosted flows ahead of tighter sanctions. Non-OPEC+ production is set to rise by 1.5 mb/d in 2025, led by the Americas. Following a 770 kb/d output decline last year, OPEC+ output could hold steady in 2025 if voluntary cuts are maintained after April.\\n- Global crude runs dropped by 570 kb/d m-o-m to 82.8 mb/d in February, extending their decline from December\\u2019s five-year high of 84.3 mb/d, on planned and unplanned outages. Throughputs are forecast to average 83.3 mb/d in 2025, up 570 kb/d y-o-y as lower OECD activity partly offsets a 930 kb/d annual increase in the non-OECD. Refining margins recovered in February, as falling crude prices lifted profitability in all regions.\\n- Global observed oil stocks fell by 40.5 mb in January, of which 26.1 mb were products. Non\\u2011OECD crude stocks plunged by 45.3 mb, dominated by China where imports declined. Total OECD stocks rose by 11.2 mb, boosted by a 25 mb build in industry crude inventories. Oil on water fell by 6.7 mb. However, preliminary data for February show total global oil stocks rebounded, lifted by an increase in oil on water.\\n- Oil prices declined by about $7/bbl in February and early March as macro sentiment soured amid escalating trade tensions, clouding the outlook for oil demand\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 411 words out of ~1344.

Additionally, Doug Bergum, Trump's nominee for Secretary of the Interior, [has promised](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/dec/01/doug-burgum-trump-interior-secretary-drilling) to open up federally-protected lands to expedited oil and gas drilling permits.\n\nHowever, OilPrice.com [reports](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Exxon-Pours-Cold-Water-On-Trumps-Drill-Baby-Drill-Plans.html) that it might not be this simple, quoting Exxon’s Upstream President Liam Mallon  and TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanne as saying it is more likely that oil producers, due to a looming surplus of oil in 2025 combined with a need to maximize shareholder returns on capital, may throttle new production in order to avoid price destruction.\n\nAccording to the Financial Times ([‘Drill, baby, drill’ is not so simple](https://www.ft.com/content/90468253-0560-4cb2-a302-2e8636234265)), a key factor will be oil prices. A Kansas City Fed survey of energy firms found that a price of \\$89/barrel was needed for drilling to substantially increase, while oil prices as of January 2025 have been on a downswing:\n\n![Price history](https://metaculus-web-media.s3.amazonaws.com/user_uploaded/Screenshot_2024-12-05_at_2.40.51%C3%A2PM.png)\n\nAccording to Baker Hughes in its recent [annual report](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1701605/000170160524000033/bkr-20231231.htm):\n\n> The Baker Hughes rig counts are an important business barometer for the drilling industry and its suppliers. When drilling rigs are active they consume products and services produced by the oil service industry. Rig count trends are driven by the exploration and development spending by oil and natural gas companies, which in turn is influenced by current and future price expectations for oil and natural gas. The counts may reflect the relative strength and stability of energy prices and overall market activity; however, these counts should not be solely relied on as other specific and pervasive conditions may exist that affect overall energy prices and market activity.\n\n> We have been providing rig counts to the public since 1944. We gather all relevant data through our field service personnel, who obtain the necessary data from routine visits to the various rigs, customers, contractors and other outside sources as necessary. We base the classification of a well as either oil or natural gas primarily upon filings made by operators in the relevant jurisdiction. This data is then compiled and distributed to various wire services and trade associations and is published on our website. We believe the counting process and resulting data is reliable; however, it is subject to our ability to obtain accurate and timely information. Rig counts are compiled weekly for the U.S. and Canada and monthly for all international rigs. Published international rig counts do not include rigs drilling in certain locations, such as onshore China because this information is not readily available.\n\n> Rigs in the U.S. and Canada are counted as active if, on the day the count is taken, the well being drilled has been started but drilling has not been completed and the well is anticipated to be of sufficient depth to be a potential consumer of our drill bits. In international areas, rigs are counted on a weekly basis and deemed active if drilling activities occurred during the majority of the week. The weekly results are then averaged for the month and published accordingly. The rig count does not include rigs that are in transit from one location to another, rigging up, being used in non-drilling activities including production testing, completion and workover, and are not expected to be significant consumers of drill bits.\n\nAccording to the rig count [FAQ](https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/rig-count-faqs), data is published each Friday at noon central US time.

A report by the International Energy Agency.\\nsitename: IEA\\ndate: 2025-03-13\\n---\\n#### About this report\\n\\nThe IEA Oil Market Report (OMR) is one of the world's most authoritative and timely sources of data, forecasts and analysis on the global oil market \\u2013 including detailed statistics and commentary on oil supply, demand, inventories, prices and refining activity, as well as oil trade for IEA and selected non-IEA countries.\\n\\n#### Highlights\\n\\n- Growth in global oil demand is set to accelerate to just over 1 mb/d this year, from 830 kb/d in 2024, reaching 103.9 mb/d. Asia accounts for almost 60% of gains, led by China where petrochemical feedstocks will provide the entirety of growth. Amid an unusually uncertain macroeconomic climate, recent delivery data have been below expectations, leading to slightly lower estimates for 4Q24 and 1Q25 growth at 1.2 mb/d y-o-y.\\n- World oil supply rose by 240 kb/d in February to 103.3 mb/d, led by OPEC+. Kazakhstan pumped at an all-time high as Tengiz ramped up, while Iran and Venezuela boosted flows ahead of tighter sanctions. Non-OPEC+ production is set to rise by 1.5 mb/d in 2025, led by the Americas. Following a 770 kb/d output decline last year, OPEC+ output could hold steady in 2025 if voluntary cuts are maintained after April.\\n- Global crude runs dropped by 570 kb/d m-o-m to 82.8 mb/d in February, extending their decline from December\\u2019s five-year high of 84.3 mb/d, on planned and unplanned outages. Throughputs are forecast to average 83.3 mb/d in 2025, up 570 kb/d y-o-y as lower OECD activity partly offsets a 930 kb/d annual increase in the non-OECD. Refining margins recovered in February, as falling crude prices lifted profitability in all regions.\\n- Global observed oil stocks fell by 40.5 mb in January, of which 26.1 mb were products. Non\\u2011OECD crude stocks plunged by 45.3 mb, dominated by China where imports declined. Total OECD stocks rose by 11.2 mb, boosted by a 25 mb build in industry crude inventories.

The rig count has remained stable at 592 for two consecutive weeks.\n\n2. **Recent Trends**: The rig count showed minor fluctuations in February 2025, with a slight increase to 593 on February 28, 2025, before stabilizing at 592.\n\n3. **Oil Market Conditions**: Oil prices have declined by about $7/bbl in February and early March 2025, with Brent futures trading near three-year lows around $70/bbl. This decline in oil prices could reduce the economic incentives for increasing drilling activity.\n\n4. **Global Oil Supply**: Global oil supply rose by 240 kb/d in February 2025, and OPEC+ plans to start unwinding voluntary production cuts in April 2025. This could lead to increased global oil supply and further pressure on prices.\n\n5. **US Production Outlook**: The United States is currently producing at record highs and is forecast to be the largest source of supply growth in 2025. This suggests a potential increase in drilling activity, although the current rig count does not reflect this yet.\n\n6. **Policy Developments**: President Donald Trump signed a resolution that could impact offshore energy development, which may influence future drilling activity.\n\nGiven the current rig count of 592 and the stable trend observed, it seems unlikely that the rig count will increase to fall within the 595 to 599 range by March 28, 2025, especially considering the downward pressure on oil prices and the recent stability in rig counts.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.2"
