  "question": "Will Turkey and Syria announce the signing of a maritime demarcation agreement before April 1, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.65,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here is the analysis regarding the likelihood of Turkey and Syria signing a maritime demarcation agreement before April 1, 2025:\n\n1. **Advanced Talks and Intentions**: There are multiple reports indicating that Turkey and Syria are in advanced talks to establish a maritime demarcation agreement. The Turkish Minister of Transport and Infrastructure has stated that Turkey is in advanced discussions with the new Syrian regime to establish an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) between the two countries.\n\n2. **Economic and Political Incentives**: The proposed agreement is modeled after the Turkish-Libyan agreement and aims to enable both countries to explore gas and oil in the Eastern Mediterranean, which would provide significant economic benefits. Syria stands to benefit from Turkey's technology, infrastructure, and experience, which could incentivize Syria to sign the agreement.\n\n3. **Improving Relations**: There are signs of improving relations between Turkey and Syria, such as discussions on economic ties and the resumption of Turkish Airlines flights to Damascus. Turkey is assisting Syria in setting up a maritime demarcation deal, suggesting that discussions on maritime boundaries may be underway.\n\n4. **Challenges and Preconditions**: Despite the progress, there are challenges. The Turkish Transport Minister mentioned that a permanent government must first be established in Damascus before the maritime agreement can be finalized. Additionally, there are concerns about the potential adverse effects on stability in the Eastern Mediterranean region and the implications for EU relations.\n\n5. **Timing and Political Climate**: The political climate in Syria, with the transitional government in place, and the need for a stable authority to finalize agreements, might delay the signing of such an agreement. However, the ongoing discussions and improving bilateral relations suggest a positive trajectory.\n\nConsidering these factors, the probability of Turkey and Syria announcing the signing of a maritime demarcation agreement before April 1, 2025, seems plausible but not certain due to the need for a stable government in Syria and potential geopolitical challenges.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.65",

Such an agreement could be instrumental in further cooperation on trade, communication, energy and defense, which is needed most for Syria, which is \"under construction.\"\n\nThe proposed maritime demarcation agreement which was modeled after the Turkish-Libyan agreement in 2019, would enable both countries for gas and oil exploration in the Eastern Mediterranean. In this respect, Syria will greatly benefit from Türkiye’s technology, infrastructure and experience. Therefore, the implementation of this agreement will not remain restricted by a delimitation. It will have ramifications in other areas, including restoring Syria’s collapsed infrastructure.\n\nTürkiye’s focus on direct negotiations, as in the case of Syria, ensures faster and more effective results for mutual benefit. In other words, Türkiye provides a model of how cooperation in the region can be satisfied not just by words but by actions. This proposed agreement could open the way for other bilateral agreements between Türkiye and Egypt, Lebanon and Palestine to fulfill the shared interests based on regional realities. In the long term, such bilateral agreements could offer much more than just sorting out the current disputes.\n\nThis initiative alarmed Greece and the Greek Cypriot administration (GCA), which distorted the interpretation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Despite its limited population, land, military and economic power, Greece follows an expansionist policy in the Eastern Mediterranean by using its’ islands.

In the long term, such bilateral agreements could offer much more than just sorting out the current disputes.\\n\\nThis initiative alarmed Greece and the Greek Cypriot administration (GCA), which distorted the interpretation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).

The Turkish Minister of Transport and Infrastructure has stated that Turkey is in advanced discussions with the new Syrian regime to establish an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) between the two countries.\n\n2. **Economic and Political Incentives**: The proposed agreement is modeled after the Turkish-Libyan agreement and aims to enable both countries to explore gas and oil in the Eastern Mediterranean, which would provide significant economic benefits. Syria stands to benefit from Turkey's technology, infrastructure, and experience, which could incentivize Syria to sign the agreement.\n\n3. **Improving Relations**: There are signs of improving relations between Turkey and Syria, such as discussions on economic ties and the resumption of Turkish Airlines flights to Damascus. Turkey is assisting Syria in setting up a maritime demarcation deal, suggesting that discussions on maritime boundaries may be underway.\n\n4. **Challenges and Preconditions**: Despite the progress, there are challenges. The Turkish Transport Minister mentioned that a permanent government must first be established in Damascus before the maritime agreement can be finalized. Additionally, there are concerns about the potential adverse effects on stability in the Eastern Mediterranean region and the implications for EU relations.\n\n5. **Timing and Political Climate**: The political climate in Syria, with the transitional government in place, and the need for a stable authority to finalize agreements, might delay the signing of such an agreement. However, the ongoing discussions and improving bilateral relations suggest a positive trajectory.\n\nConsidering these factors, the probability of Turkey and Syria announcing the signing of a maritime demarcation agreement before April 1, 2025, seems plausible but not certain due to the need for a stable government in Syria and potential geopolitical challenges.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.65"
