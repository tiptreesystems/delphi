  "question": "Will the median person on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index be from the United States on March 20, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.75,
  "reasoning": "Based on the information gathered, here are some key points relevant to the question:\n\n1. **Bloomberg Billionaires Index**: The index is updated daily and reflects changes in the markets and economy. As of December 28, 2025, the 250th-ranked person was Scott Duncan from the United States. This suggests that, at least recently, the median billionaire was from the U.S.\n\n2. **Wealth Distribution Trends**: The World Wealth Report and other sources indicate that there have been significant changes in wealth distribution, with a concentration of wealth among a few individuals, many of whom are based in the U.S. The presence of U.S.-based tech and financial billionaires is particularly strong.\n\n3. **Economic and Political Influence**: There is a notable influence of billionaires in the U.S. government and economy, with many of the world's richest individuals being from the U.S. This suggests a strong likelihood that U.S. billionaires will continue to hold significant positions on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nGiven these factors, the probability that the median person on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index will be from the United States on March 20, 2025, is relatively high. The current trends and recent data support the likelihood of a U.S. individual holding the 250th position.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.75",

Right now, in 2025, there is an awakening to the dangers of oligarchy—when a few billionaires rule the world. In his farewell speech, outgoing President Biden left us with this warning:\n\n*Today, an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms, and a fair shot for everyone to get ahead. We see the consequences all across America.*\n\nWhen my book warning of the corporate problem was released in 1995, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) had recently passed, followed by the formation of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The world began to realise that for-profit corporations were surpassing democratic governments as society’s most powerful governing institutions. The book quickly became an international bestseller.\n\nThe extraordinary information technology breakthroughs since 1995 produced the billionaires who currently control them. The world is now witnessing [an alliance](https://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-tapped-unprecedented-13-billionaires-top-administration-roles/story?id=116872968) of tech and financial billionaires that has taken control of the administrative, judicial, and legislative branches of the world’s most powerful government.\n\nTheir clear intention is to use that control to defend and further advance their personal monetary interests in disregard of consequences for the wellbeing of Earth and society—and especially the interests of members of the struggling working class whose votes put the billionaires in power. We must use this latest awakening to create a deeply democratic future free of extremes of wealth and power.\n\nFollowing World War II, the world arrived at a significant moment of opportunity when decolonisation spawned a temporary global burst of democracy and a drive to create and share prosperity equitably on a global scale. The commitment to economic development sparked hope that assets and power would henceforth be democratically sh…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 358 words out of ~1306.

      "content": "Based on the information gathered, here are some key points relevant to the question:\n\n1. **Bloomberg Billionaires Index**: The index is updated daily and reflects changes in the markets and economy. As of December 28, 2025, the 250th-ranked person was Scott Duncan from the United States. This suggests that, at least recently, the median billionaire was from the U.S.\n\n2. **Wealth Distribution Trends**: The World Wealth Report and other sources indicate that there have been significant changes in wealth distribution, with a concentration of wealth among a few individuals, many of whom are based in the U.S. The presence of U.S.-based tech and financial billionaires is particularly strong.\n\n3. **Economic and Political Influence**: There is a notable influence of billionaires in the U.S. government and economy, with many of the world's richest individuals being from the U.S. This suggests a strong likelihood that U.S. billionaires will continue to hold significant positions on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nGiven these factors, the probability that the median person on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index will be from the United States on March 20, 2025, is relatively high. The current trends and recent data support the likelihood of a U.S. individual holding the 250th position.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.75"
