  "question": "Will François Bayrou step down or be removed from his position as Prime Minister of France before March 31, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.4,
  "reasoning": "I was unable to find any recent news articles specifically mentioning François Bayrou or a no-confidence vote in France as of March 2025. However, I did find a general economic forecast for France from the European Commission, which mentions some economic challenges but does not provide specific information about the political stability or any recent developments regarding the Prime Minister.\n\nGiven the background information that France has had a high turnover of Prime Ministers recently and the current political instability with multiple factions vying for power, there is a significant risk of political upheaval. However, without specific news of a no-confidence vote or resignation, it is difficult to assess the immediate probability of François Bayrou stepping down or being removed.\n\nConsidering the historical context and the lack of specific recent developments, I will estimate the probability based on the general instability and historical turnover rate.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.4",
