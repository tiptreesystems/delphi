  "question": "Will Recovery Inc. win the 2025 Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting?",
  "probability": 0.2,
  "reasoning": "Based on the information gathered:\n\n1. **Recovery Inc.** is confirmed to be a finalist for the 2025 Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting.\n2. The winner of the 2025 Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting has not been announced yet, as the announcement is scheduled for April 3, 2025.\n3. The current available information does not provide any specific predictions or analyses about the likelihood of Recovery Inc. winning the prize.\n\nGiven that Recovery Inc. is one of the finalists, it has a chance of winning. However, without specific insights or predictions from experts or additional context about the competition, it's challenging to assign a high probability.\n\nAssuming there are multiple finalists and without specific evidence suggesting Recovery Inc. is favored, a reasonable estimate might be to assign an equal probability to each finalist. If there are, for example, five finalists, the probability would be approximately 0.2 (20%).\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.2",

The winner of the 2025 Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting has not been announced yet, as the announcement is scheduled for April 3, 2025.\n3. The current available information does not provide any specific predictions or analyses about the likelihood of Recovery Inc. winning the prize.\n\nGiven that Recovery Inc. is one of the finalists, it has a chance of winning. However, without specific insights or predictions from experts or additional context about the competition, it's challenging to assign a high probability.\n\nAssuming there are multiple finalists and without specific evidence suggesting Recovery Inc. is favored, a reasonable estimate might be to assign an equal probability to each finalist. If there are, for example, five finalists, the probability would be approximately 0.2 (20%).\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.2"
