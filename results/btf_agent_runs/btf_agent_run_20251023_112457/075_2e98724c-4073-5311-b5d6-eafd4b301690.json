  "question": "Will 50% or more of respondents to to Gallup's 2025 survey express sympathies for the the Israelis?",
  "probability": 0.65,
  "reasoning": "Based on the evidence gathered, here are some key points regarding American sympathies towards Israelis and Palestinians:\n\n1. **Historical Trends**: Historically, Americans have shown more sympathy towards Israelis than Palestinians. However, the gap has been narrowing. From 2001 to 2019, the gap was 42 percentage points, but it has decreased to 30 points in recent years.\n\n2. **Religious Influence**: The decline in religiosity among Americans, particularly among Protestants who have traditionally been strong supporters of Israel, is contributing to the shift in sympathies. The percentage of Protestants has decreased, while the percentage of Americans with no religious affiliation (who tend to be more sympathetic to Palestinians) has increased significantly.\n\n3. **Demographic Shifts**: Young Americans (18-29) are now roughly evenly divided in their sympathies between Israelis and Palestinians. This demographic shift could influence overall public opinion in the future.\n\n4. **Political Divides**: There is a notable political divide, with Republicans generally showing strong support for Israel, while Democrats are more divided. In 2021, 42% of Democrats sympathized with Israelis, while 39% sympathized with Palestinians.\n\n5. **Overall Favorability**: Despite these shifts, Israel has maintained a favorable image among Americans, with no less than 58% viewing Israel favorably since 2001.\n\nGiven these trends, while the overall favorability towards Israel remains relatively high, the narrowing gap and demographic changes suggest a potential decrease in the percentage of Americans who might express sympathies for Israelis in the upcoming Gallup survey. However, it is still likely that a majority will sympathize with Israelis, though the margin might be closer than in previous years.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.65",

The latest results are based on a Feb. 3-18 poll that was conducted before violence erupted in the region in early May. Thus, they provide a backdrop to attitudes ahead of that conflict, rather than reflecting post-conflict attitudes. Additional Gallup analysis of these data is available in [Gallup's March 19 news article](https://news.gallup.com/poll/340331/americans-favor-israel-warming-palestinians.aspx).\n\n**Positive Views of Israel Largely Unchanged**\n\nAmericans' overall impression of Israel has been largely positive, with no less than 58% viewing that nation favorably since 2001.\n\nLine graph. Yearly trend from 2001 to 2021 in the percentage of Americans with a very or mostly favorable view of Israel. Favorability has been high throughout the trend, ranging from 58% to 75%, with the highest figure recorded in 2021.\n\nIsrael's image has remained positive among both party groups over the past two decades, although more positive among Republicans (including independents who lean Republican) than among Democrats (including Democratic leaners). Most recently, 85% of Republicans and 66% of Democrats viewed Israel favorably.\n\nAmericans have also remained more partial to the Israelis' side than to the Palestinians' when asked where their sympathies lie in the Mideast conflict.

      "content": "Based on the evidence gathered, here are some key points regarding American sympathies towards Israelis and Palestinians:\n\n1. **Historical Trends**: Historically, Americans have shown more sympathy towards Israelis than Palestinians. However, the gap has been narrowing. From 2001 to 2019, the gap was 42 percentage points, but it has decreased to 30 points in recent years.\n\n2. **Religious Influence**: The decline in religiosity among Americans, particularly among Protestants who have traditionally been strong supporters of Israel, is contributing to the shift in sympathies. The percentage of Protestants has decreased, while the percentage of Americans with no religious affiliation (who tend to be more sympathetic to Palestinians) has increased significantly.\n\n3. **Demographic Shifts**: Young Americans (18-29) are now roughly evenly divided in their sympathies between Israelis and Palestinians. This demographic shift could influence overall public opinion in the future.\n\n4. **Political Divides**: There is a notable political divide, with Republicans generally showing strong support for Israel, while Democrats are more divided. In 2021, 42% of Democrats sympathized with Israelis, while 39% sympathized with Palestinians.\n\n5. **Overall Favorability**: Despite these shifts, Israel has maintained a favorable image among Americans, with no less than 58% viewing Israel favorably since 2001.\n\nGiven these trends, while the overall favorability towards Israel remains relatively high, the narrowing gap and demographic changes suggest a potential decrease in the percentage of Americans who might express sympathies for Israelis in the upcoming Gallup survey. However, it is still likely that a majority will sympathize with Israelis, though the margin might be closer than in previous years.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.65"
