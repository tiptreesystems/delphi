  "question": "Will the US frac spread count for the week ending March 28, 2025 fall between 228 and 234 (inclusive)?",
  "probability": 0.1,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered information, here is the analysis of the US frac spread count:\n\n1. **Recent Trends:**\n   - On February 28, 2025, the total frac spreads were 214.\n   - On March 7, 2025, the total frac spreads decreased to 210.\n   - On March 14, 2025, the total frac spreads increased slightly to 212.\n\n2. **Historical Context:**\n   - The frac spread count has been fluctuating slightly week over week, with small increases and decreases.\n   - The count has not shown any significant upward trend that would suggest a rapid increase to the range of 228 to 234 within the next two weeks.\n\n3. **Probability Assessment:**\n   - Given the current count of 212 and the recent trend of small weekly changes, reaching a count between 228 and 234 by March 28, 2025, would require a substantial increase in the frac spread count over the next two weeks.\n   - The historical data does not indicate a pattern of such rapid increases in the frac spread count.\n\nBased on this analysis, the probability that the US frac spread count for the week ending March 28, 2025, will fall between 228 and 234 (inclusive) is low.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1",

A report by the International Energy Agency.\nsitename: IEA\ndate: 2025-03-13\n---\n#### About this report\n\nThe IEA Oil Market Report (OMR) is one of the world's most authoritative and timely sources of data, forecasts and analysis on the global oil market – including detailed statistics and commentary on oil supply, demand, inventories, prices and refining activity, as well as oil trade for IEA and selected non-IEA countries.\n\n#### Highlights\n\n- Growth in global oil demand is set to accelerate to just over 1 mb/d this year, from 830 kb/d in 2024, reaching 103.9 mb/d. Asia accounts for almost 60% of gains, led by China where petrochemical feedstocks will provide the entirety of growth. Amid an unusually uncertain macroeconomic climate, recent delivery data have been below expectations, leading to slightly lower estimates for 4Q24 and 1Q25 growth at 1.2 mb/d y-o-y.\n- World oil supply rose by 240 kb/d in February to 103.3 mb/d, led by OPEC+. Kazakhstan pumped at an all-time high as Tengiz ramped up, while Iran and Venezuela boosted flows ahead of tighter sanctions. Non-OPEC+ production is set to rise by 1.5 mb/d in 2025, led by the Americas. Following a 770 kb/d output decline last year, OPEC+ output could hold steady in 2025 if voluntary cuts are maintained after April.\n- Global crude runs dropped by 570 kb/d m-o-m to 82.8 mb/d in February, extending their decline from December’s five-year high of 84.3 mb/d, on planned and unplanned outages. Throughputs are forecast to average 83.3 mb/d in 2025, up 570 kb/d y-o-y as lower OECD activity partly offsets a 930 kb/d annual increase in the non-OECD. Refining margins recovered in February, as falling crude prices lifted profitability in all regions.\n- Global observed oil stocks fell by 40.5 mb in January, of which 26.1 mb were products. Non‑OECD crude stocks plunged by 45.3 mb, dominated by China where imports declined. Total OECD stocks rose by 11.2 mb, boosted by a 25 mb build in industry crude inventories. Oil on water fell by 6.7 mb. However, preliminary data for February show total global oil stocks rebounded, lifted by an increase in oil on water.\n- Oil prices declined by about $7/bbl in February and early March as macro sentiment soured amid escalating trade tensions, clouding the outlook for oil demand…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 411 words out of ~1344.

Asia accounts for almost 60% of gains, led by China where petrochemical feedstocks will provide the entirety of growth. Amid an unusually uncertain macroeconomic climate, recent delivery data have been below expectations, leading to slightly lower estimates for 4Q24 and 1Q25 growth at 1.2 mb/d y-o-y.\n- World oil supply rose by 240 kb/d in February to 103.3 mb/d, led by OPEC+. Kazakhstan pumped at an all-time high as Tengiz ramped up, while Iran and Venezuela boosted flows ahead of tighter sanctions. Non-OPEC+ production is set to rise by 1.5 mb/d in 2025, led by the Americas. Following a 770 kb/d output decline last year, OPEC+ output could hold steady in 2025 if voluntary cuts are maintained after April.\n- Global crude runs dropped by 570 kb/d m-o-m to 82.8 mb/d in February, extending their decline from December’s five-year high of 84.3 mb/d, on planned and unplanned outages. Throughputs are forecast to average 83.3 mb/d in 2025, up 570 kb/d y-o-y as lower OECD activity partly offsets a 930 kb/d annual increase in the non-OECD. Refining margins recovered in February, as falling crude prices lifted profitability in all regions.\n- Global observed oil stocks fell by 40.5 mb in January, of which 26.1 mb were products. Non‑OECD crude stocks plunged by 45.3 mb, dominated by China where imports declined. Total OECD stocks rose by 11.2 mb, boosted by a 25 mb build in industry crude inventories. Oil on water fell by 6.7 mb. However, preliminary data for February show total global oil stocks rebounded, lifted by an increase in oil on water.\n- Oil prices declined by about $7/bbl in February and early March as macro sentiment soured amid escalating trade tensions, clouding the outlook for oil demand…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 411 words out of ~1344.

A report by the International Energy Agency.\\nsitename: IEA\\ndate: 2025-03-13\\n---\\n#### About this report\\n\\nThe IEA Oil Market Report (OMR) is one of the world's most authoritative and timely sources of data, forecasts and analysis on the global oil market \\u2013 including detailed statistics and commentary on oil supply, demand, inventories, prices and refining activity, as well as oil trade for IEA and selected non-IEA countries.\\n\\n#### Highlights\\n\\n- Growth in global oil demand is set to accelerate to just over 1 mb/d this year, from 830 kb/d in 2024, reaching 103.9 mb/d. Asia accounts for almost 60% of gains, led by China where petrochemical feedstocks will provide the entirety of growth. Amid an unusually uncertain macroeconomic climate, recent delivery data have been below expectations, leading to slightly lower estimates for 4Q24 and 1Q25 growth at 1.2 mb/d y-o-y.\\n- World oil supply rose by 240 kb/d in February to 103.3 mb/d, led by OPEC+. Kazakhstan pumped at an all-time high as Tengiz ramped up, while Iran and Venezuela boosted flows ahead of tighter sanctions. Non-OPEC+ production is set to rise by 1.5 mb/d in 2025, led by the Americas. Following a 770 kb/d output decline last year, OPEC+ output could hold steady in 2025 if voluntary cuts are maintained after April.\\n- Global crude runs dropped by 570 kb/d m-o-m to 82.8 mb/d in February, extending their decline from December\\u2019s five-year high of 84.3 mb/d, on planned and unplanned outages. Throughputs are forecast to average 83.3 mb/d in 2025, up 570 kb/d y-o-y as lower OECD activity partly offsets a 930 kb/d annual increase in the non-OECD. Refining margins recovered in February, as falling crude prices lifted profitability in all regions.\\n- Global observed oil stocks fell by 40.5 mb in January, of which 26.1 mb were products. Non\\u2011OECD crude stocks plunged by 45.3 mb, dominated by China where imports declined. Total OECD stocks rose by 11.2 mb, boosted by a 25 mb build in industry crude inventories. Oil on water fell by 6.7 mb. However, preliminary data for February show total global oil stocks rebounded, lifted by an increase in oil on water.\\n- Oil prices declined by about $7/bbl in February and early March as macro sentiment soured amid escalating trade tensions, clouding the outlook for oil demand\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 411 words out of ~1344.

      "content": "Based on the gathered information, here is the analysis of the US frac spread count:\n\n1. **Recent Trends:**\n   - On February 28, 2025, the total frac spreads were 214.\n   - On March 7, 2025, the total frac spreads decreased to 210.\n   - On March 14, 2025, the total frac spreads increased slightly to 212.\n\n2. **Historical Context:**\n   - The frac spread count has been fluctuating slightly week over week, with small increases and decreases.\n   - The count has not shown any significant upward trend that would suggest a rapid increase to the range of 228 to 234 within the next two weeks.\n\n3. **Probability Assessment:**\n   - Given the current count of 212 and the recent trend of small weekly changes, reaching a count between 228 and 234 by March 28, 2025, would require a substantial increase in the frac spread count over the next two weeks.\n   - The historical data does not indicate a pattern of such rapid increases in the frac spread count.\n\nBased on this analysis, the probability that the US frac spread count for the week ending March 28, 2025, will fall between 228 and 234 (inclusive) is low.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1"
