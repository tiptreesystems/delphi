  "question": "Will the government of Greenland officially announce a date for an independence referendum, before April 6, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.6,
  "reasoning": "Based on the information gathered:\n\n1. Greenland held a parliamentary election on March 11, 2025, with independence being a key issue.\n2. Prime Minister Mute Egede has suggested that a national referendum on independence could be held in early April 2025.\n3. A public poll in January 2025 showed that 84% of polled voters supported independence.\n4. The pro-independence parties hold a majority in the Greenlandic Parliament, indicating strong political support for independence.\n5. The legal framework for Greenland's independence is established under the Act on Greenland Self-Government, which allows for a referendum to initiate negotiations with Denmark.\n\nGiven these factors, there is a strong political and public momentum towards independence in Greenland. However, as of the present date, March 26, 2025, there has been no official announcement of a specific date for an independence referendum. The suggestion that a referendum could be held in early April 2025 is promising, but without an official announcement, the probability remains uncertain.\n\nConsidering the current information and the proximity to the deadline of April 6, 2025, I estimate the probability that the government of Greenland will officially announce a date for an independence referendum before the deadline as follows:\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.6",

This primer is intended to provide business leaders, journalists and stakeholders around the world with crucial context.\n\n**RECENT ELECTIONS**\n\n- Greenland’s most recent election was in 2021.\n- Total of about 41,000 registered voters.\n- About 27,000 votes cast (66% turnout).\n- The two pro-independence parties, Inuit and Naleraq, won a majority of seats: 16 of 31, signaling support for independence.\n- Counting the Siumut party, the majority of the Greenlandic Parliament today is controlled by pro-independence parties, representing 26 of the 31 seats.\n\n- Historically, Greenlandic elections have tended to be single-issue referendums.\n- For example, in 2013, it was about limiting uranium mining.\n- In 2021, the main issue was creating more opportunities in mining.\n\n- The 2021 election helped usher in the Greenlandic Mining Act that improved the nation’s ability to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) for mining activities.\n\n**SUPPORT FOR INDEPENDENCE**\n\n- This election on March 11 will elect 31 members of the Parliament.\n- Prime Minister Mute Egede has suggested a national referendum on independence could be held in early April.\n- A new pro-independence party called “Quelleq” gained ballot access for the election.\n- In a public poll released in January, the three pro-independence parties have about 68% of the vote.\n- In January, 84% of polled voters supported independence.\n\n**THE LAW AND INDEPENDENCE**\n\n- In 2009, Denmark worked with Greenland to create the “Act on Greenland Self-Government.” Section 21 lays out the process for Greenlandic independence:\n- Decision regarding Greenland’s independence shall be taken by the people of Greenland. (2) If decision is taken pursuant to subsection (1), negotiations shall commence between the Government and Naalakkersuisut with a view to the introduction of independence for Greenland.

(3) An agreement on independence shall be subject to approval by the Inatsisartut and the Danish Parliament.\\n\\n**GEOPOLITICAL CONTEXT**\\n\\n- Greenland is strategically important due to its location in the Arctic.\\n- The United States has shown interest in Greenland, particularly under the Trump administration.\\n- Greenland’s natural resources, including rare earth minerals, are of global interest.\\n\\n**CONCLUSION**\\n\\n- The upcoming election is critical for Greenland’s future.\\n- The outcome could significantly influence the timeline for an independence referendum.\\n- The pro-independence sentiment is strong, but the exact timing of a referendum remains uncertain.\",\"title\":\"Everything You Need to Know About Greenland's Election on March 11\",\"question_id\":\"6a6f9ecb-95a4-5e1a-90a9-6fe5ab87a39c\",\"question\":\"Will the government of Greenland officially announce a date for an independence referendum, before April 6, 2025?\",\"background\":\"Greenland, population 56,000, is the largest non-continent island in the world and has been settled for 4,000-5,000 years. As of the writing of this question, Greenland is a Danish territory which has been self-governing since 1979 and which unveiled a draft constitution in 2023, a move that was widely regarded as an important milestone on its journey to independence. In November 2008, 75% of Greenlanders voted for the Self-Government Act, which greatly expanded the island's autonomy. Under an agreement signed with Denmark the next year, Greenland can declare independence after a successful referendum. Greenland has potentially the second largest reserves of rare earth deposits in the world potentially offering an alternative source for the United States and its European allies, which are dependent on China for much of their supply. Rare earths are essential components of a wide range of modern technological products, ranging from cell phones to electric vehicles. From a geopolitical perspective, Greenland is strategically located in the Arctic, home to Thule Air Base and close enough to Russia to make it a potential support point for tracking Russian military operations according to CSIS. On Tuesday January 8, 2025, then-President Elect Donald Trump said, \\\"We need Greenland for national security purposes.\\\" His eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., landed in Greenland for a visit, with President-Elect Trump writing: \\\"Don Jr. and my Reps landing in Greenland. The reception has been great. They, and the Free World, need safety, security, strength, and PEACE! This is a deal that must happen. MAGA. MAKE GREENLAND GREAT AGAIN!\\\" Since Denmark has firmly rejected the notion of America buying Greenland, another path to becoming part of the United State might lie in an independence referendum. Greenland is holding parliamentary elections in April 2025, and Greenlandic Prime Minister Múte Bourup Egede has hinted that a referendum on independence could come in tandem with those elections.\",\"resolution_criteria\":\"This question resolves as Yes if, before April 6, 2025, the government of Greenland or any of its agencies officially announce (according to credible sources) a specific date on which a referendum on independence from Denmark is scheduled. If no such announcement occurs before April 6, 2025, this question resolves as No.\",\"present_date\":\"2025-03-26T10:36:36.463036\"}"

      "content": "Based on the information gathered:\n\n1. Greenland held a parliamentary election on March 11, 2025, with independence being a key issue.\n2. Prime Minister Mute Egede has suggested that a national referendum on independence could be held in early April 2025.\n3. A public poll in January 2025 showed that 84% of polled voters supported independence.\n4. The pro-independence parties hold a majority in the Greenlandic Parliament, indicating strong political support for independence.\n5. The legal framework for Greenland's independence is established under the Act on Greenland Self-Government, which allows for a referendum to initiate negotiations with Denmark.\n\nGiven these factors, there is a strong political and public momentum towards independence in Greenland. However, as of the present date, March 26, 2025, there has been no official announcement of a specific date for an independence referendum. The suggestion that a referendum could be held in early April 2025 is promising, but without an official announcement, the probability remains uncertain.\n\nConsidering the current information and the proximity to the deadline of April 6, 2025, I estimate the probability that the government of Greenland will officially announce a date for an independence referendum before the deadline as follows:\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.6"
