  "question": "Will either metac-GPT4o or metac-o1 finish with a rank between 10 and 25 inclusive in the Q1 2025 Quarterly Cup?",
  "probability": 0.35,
  "reasoning": "Based on the extracted evidence from the Metaculus page regarding the Q1 2025 Quarterly Cup, the community prediction for the highest rank of either metac-GPT4o or metac-o1 is as follows:\n\n1. **Community Prediction Median**: 29.61\n2. **Lower 25% Quartile**: 11.69\n3. **Upper 75% Quartile**: 75.72\n\nThe community prediction indicates that there is a reasonable probability that either metac-GPT4o or metac-o1 could finish with a rank between 10 and 25. Specifically, the lower quartile of the prediction is 11.69, which falls within the target range of 10 to 25. This suggests that there is at least a 25% probability that one of the bots will achieve a rank within this range.\n\nGiven this information, along with the fact that the median prediction is 29.61, which is not far from the upper bound of the target range, I would estimate the probability of the event occurring (either bot finishing between rank 10 and 25) to be slightly higher than the lower quartile probability, considering the distribution and the nature of forecasting tournaments where performance can vary significantly.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.35",

Quarterly Cups have been some of the most popular tournaments on the site with hundreds of users forecasting on at least one tournament question in each quarter. In Q3 2024, Metaculus launched the [AI Forecasting Benchmark Tournament series](https://www.metaculus.com/notebooks/25525/openai-anthropic-donate-credits-for-ai-forecasting-benchmark-tournament-asknews-provides-free-news-source/), which compares bots on forecasting questions. Bots are also allowed to forecast in other questions too (although they are not included in the Community Prediction) and currently Metaculus has two bots compete in the Quarterly Cup: metac-GPT4o and metac-o1.\n\nBoth bots consist of a combination of a GPT model and AskNews for search. Both forecast every two days, using the same basic prompt (example for binary questions):\n\n> You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.Your interview question is:\n> \\{title}\n> ‎\n> Question background:\n> \\{background}\n> ‎\n> This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

You do not produce forecasts yourself.\n>\n> Note that bots do not affect forecaster ranks or scores in any way.\nResolution criteria: This question will resolve as YES if either metac-GPT4o or metac-o1 finish with a rank between 10 and 25 inclusive in the Q1 2025 Quarterly Cup Leaderboard after all questions besides this one have been resolved and no more questions are set to open. Otherwise, it will resolve as NO.\nFine print: The bots might disappear from the tournament leaderboard after a question has resolved.

Quarterly Cups have been some of the most popular tournaments on the site with hundreds of users forecasting on at least one tournament question in each quarter. In Q3 2024, Metaculus launched the AI Forecasting Benchmark Tournament series, which compares bots on forecasting questions. Bots are also allowed to forecast in other questions too (although they are not included in the Community Prediction) and currently Metaculus has two bots compete in the Quarterly Cup: metac-GPT4o and metac-o1. Both bots consist of a combination of a GPT model and AskNews for search. Both forecast every two days, using the same basic prompt.\",\"resolution_criteria\":\"This question will resolve as YES if either metac-GPT4o or metac-o1 finish with a rank between 10 and 25 inclusive in the Q1 2025 Quarterly Cup Leaderboard after all questions besides this one have been resolved and no more questions are set to open.

      "content": "Based on the extracted evidence from the Metaculus page regarding the Q1 2025 Quarterly Cup, the community prediction for the highest rank of either metac-GPT4o or metac-o1 is as follows:\n\n1. **Community Prediction Median**: 29.61\n2. **Lower 25% Quartile**: 11.69\n3. **Upper 75% Quartile**: 75.72\n\nThe community prediction indicates that there is a reasonable probability that either metac-GPT4o or metac-o1 could finish with a rank between 10 and 25. Specifically, the lower quartile of the prediction is 11.69, which falls within the target range of 10 to 25. This suggests that there is at least a 25% probability that one of the bots will achieve a rank within this range.\n\nGiven this information, along with the fact that the median prediction is 29.61, which is not far from the upper bound of the target range, I would estimate the probability of the event occurring (either bot finishing between rank 10 and 25) to be slightly higher than the lower quartile probability, considering the distribution and the nature of forecasting tournaments where performance can vary significantly.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.35"
