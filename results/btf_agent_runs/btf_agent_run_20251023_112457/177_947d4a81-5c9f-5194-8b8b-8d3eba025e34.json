  "question": "Will Donald Trump sign between 60 and 90 (inclusive) executive orders in February and March 2025?",
  "probability": 0.95,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here is the analysis:\n\n1. **Current Executive Order Count**: As of February 6, 2025, Donald Trump had already signed 58 executive orders. This indicates a high frequency of executive order issuance early in his term.\n\n2. **Historical Context**: The number of executive orders signed by presidents in their first months has been increasing over the years. Trump himself set a record in his previous term with 23 executive orders in Q1 2017.\n\n3. **Trend and Pace**: Given the pace of 58 executive orders by February 6, 2025, it is reasonable to expect that Trump could continue signing executive orders at a high rate through February and March.\n\n4. **Resolution Criteria**: The question resolves as \"YES\" if Trump signs between 60 and 90 executive orders in February and March 2025. With 58 already signed by early February, reaching the lower bound of 60 seems highly probable.\n\n5. **Official Sources**: The Federal Register and other credible sources like the White House website are tracking these orders, ensuring that the count is accurate and up-to-date.\n\nConsidering the above points, the probability that Donald Trump will sign between 60 and 90 executive orders in February and March 2025 is very high.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.95",

The legal or constitutional basis for executive orders has multiple sources. Article Two of the United States Constitution gives presidents broad executive and enforcement authority to use their discretion to determine how to enforce the law or to otherwise manage the resources and staff of the executive branch. The ability to make such orders is also based on expressed or implied Acts of Congress that delegate to the president some degree of discretionary power (delegated legislation).\n\nThe number of Executive Orders that presidents issue in their first months in office has been rising significantly over the past years:\n\n| President      | Period  | Number of EOs |\n| -------------- | ------- | ------------- |\n| Bill Clinton   | Q1 1993 | 9             |\n| George W. Bush | Q1 2021 | 8             |\n| Barack Obama   | Q1 2009 | 18            |\n| Donald Trump   | Q1 2017 | 23            |\n| Joe Biden      | Q1 2021 | 37            |\n\nTrump surpassed all previous records in the first 8 days in office, [having signed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_executive_orders_in_the_second_presidency_of_Donald_Trump) 58 executive orders as of February 6, 2025.\nResolution criteria: This question will resolve as YES if Donald Trump signs between 60 and 90 (inclusive) executive orders in February and March 2025, according to [the Federal Register](https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders).\n\n##### Note that this question closes early, on March 10, 2025.\nFine print: * An Executive Order is any presidential document with an Executive Order number. Orders that do not have such a number will not count for this question.\n* If the Federal Register delays in publishing an Executive Order, Metaculus might use alternative credible sources to resolve this question, such as [the Presidential Actions archive](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/).\n* This question will resolve according to the number of Executive Orders signed by Donald Trump in February and March, 2025. The date of publication is immaterial for this question.\npresent_date: 2025-03-26T12:28:22.768467\n\n\nMake sure to use the tools at your disposal to gather relevant information before providing your final probability estimate.\n\nYou may reason through the problem, but you MUST end your response with:\nFINAL PROBABILITY: [your decimal number between 0 and 1]"

      "content": "Based on the gathered evidence, here is the analysis:\n\n1. **Current Executive Order Count**: As of February 6, 2025, Donald Trump had already signed 58 executive orders. This indicates a high frequency of executive order issuance early in his term.\n\n2. **Historical Context**: The number of executive orders signed by presidents in their first months has been increasing over the years. Trump himself set a record in his previous term with 23 executive orders in Q1 2017.\n\n3. **Trend and Pace**: Given the pace of 58 executive orders by February 6, 2025, it is reasonable to expect that Trump could continue signing executive orders at a high rate through February and March.\n\n4. **Resolution Criteria**: The question resolves as \"YES\" if Trump signs between 60 and 90 executive orders in February and March 2025. With 58 already signed by early February, reaching the lower bound of 60 seems highly probable.\n\n5. **Official Sources**: The Federal Register and other credible sources like the White House website are tracking these orders, ensuring that the count is accurate and up-to-date.\n\nConsidering the above points, the probability that Donald Trump will sign between 60 and 90 executive orders in February and March 2025 is very high.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.95"
