  "question": "Will the number of active US drilling rigs be 570 to 574 on March 28, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.15,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered information, here is the analysis:\n\n1. **Current Rig Count**: As of March 14, 2025, the total number of active US drilling rigs is 592. The rig count has remained stable at this number for the weeks ending March 7 and March 14, 2025. This indicates a stable trend slightly above the target range of 570 to 574.\n\n2. **Oil Prices**: The EIA forecasts that the Brent crude oil spot price will rise from about $70 per barrel to $75 per barrel by the third quarter of 2025. However, oil prices are currently on a downswing, which may affect future drilling activity. Lower oil prices could lead to reduced drilling if companies do not find it economically viable to maintain or increase rig counts.\n\n3. **Policy Changes**: The Trump administration has issued directives to roll back regulations on the oil and gas sector and accelerate drilling and pipeline development. However, these efforts face legal challenges, and market forces such as energy prices may deter companies from increasing drilling.\n\n4. **Market Forces**: Despite government efforts to increase production, energy prices and other market forces may deter energy companies from increasing drilling. The current rig count is stable and above the target range, and there is no strong indication of a significant decrease in the immediate future.\n\nGiven these factors, the probability that the number of active US drilling rigs will be between 570 and 574 on March 28, 2025, is relatively low. The current rig count is stable at 592, and while there are factors that could lead to a decrease, the target range is quite specific and lower than current levels.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.15",

We expect global oil inventories will fall in the second quarter of 2025 (2Q25) in part due to decreasing crude oil production in Iran and Venezuela. As a result, the Brent crude oil spot price in our forecast rises from about $70 per barrel (b) to $75/b by 3Q25. However, we expect oil inventories will build and place downward pressure on crude oil prices in late-2025 and through 2026 when we expect[OPEC+ unwinds production cuts](https://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/press_room/7477.htm)and[non-OPEC oil production grows](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=64565). As a result, we forecast the Brent crude oil price will fall to an average of $68/b in 2026.\n\n**Natural gas consumption and inventories.**Cold weather during January and February led to more consumption of natural gas and large withdrawals of natural gas from inventories. We now expect natural gas inventories to fall below 1.7 trillion cubic feet at the end of March, which is 10% below the previous five-year average and 6% less natural gas in storage than we had expected last month. We also increased our forecast for overall electricity generation over the next two years. As a result, we now expect the electric power sector will use more than 36 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas on average in 2025 and 2026, 2% and 1% more, respectively, than last month. Overall, we expect natural gas in storage to be 4% lower in 2025 and 3% lower in 2026 compared with what we had forecast last month.\n\n**Natural gas prices.**Because we now expect more consumption of natural gas in 2025 and 2026 and less natural gas in storge, we have raised our forecast Henry Hub spot price. We expect the Henry Hub price will average around $4.20 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in 2025, 11% more than last month’s forecast. We expect the annual average price in 2026 will be near $4.50/MMBtu, up 8% from last month.\n\n**Electricity consumption.**We expect total U.S. electricity sales will increase by 3% in 2025, led by strong growth in th…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 391 words out of ~901.

We expect global oil inventories will fall in the second quarter of 2025 (2Q25) in part due to decreasing crude oil production in Iran and Venezuela. As a result, the Brent crude oil spot price in our forecast rises from about $70 per barrel (b) to $75/b by 3Q25. However, we expect oil inventories will build and place downward pressure on crude oil prices in late-2025 and through 2026 when we expect[OPEC+ unwinds production cuts](https://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/press_room/7477.htm)and[non-OPEC oil production grows](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=64565). As a result, we forecast the Brent crude oil price will fall to an average of $68/b in 2026.\n\n**Natural gas consumption and inventories.**Cold weather during January and February led to more consumption of natural gas and large withdrawals of natural gas from inventories. We now expect natural gas inventories to fall below 1.7 trillion cubic feet at the end of March, which is 10% below the previous five-year average and 6% less natural gas in storage than we had expected last month. We also increased our forecast for overall electricity generation over the next two years. As a result, we now expect the electric power sector will use more than 36 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas on average in 2025 and 2026, 2% and 1% more, respectively, than last month. Overall, we expect natural gas in storage to be 4% lower in 2025 and 3% lower in 2026 compared with what we had forecast last month.\n\n**Natural gas prices.**Because we now expect more consumption of natural gas in 2025 and 2026 and less natural gas in storge, we have raised our forecast Henry Hub spot price. We expect the Henry Hub price will average around $4.20 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in 2025, 11% more than last month’s forecast. We expect the annual average price in 2026 will be near $4.50/MMBtu, up 8% from last month.\n\n**Electricity consumption.**We expect total U.S. electricity sales will increase by 3% in 2025, led by strong growth in th…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 391 words out of ~901.

To be eligible to win prizes in the competition you must register for the tournament. The last day to register is March 24, 2025. Sign up or check your registration status* [*here*](https://www.metaculus.com/bridgewater/)*.*\n\n***\n\nIn his 2024 campaign, Donald Trump ran on a slogan of \"[Drill, baby, drill](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/13/nx-s1-5181963/trump-promises-more-drilling-in-the-u-s-to-boost-fossil-fuel-production),\" saying in September 2024, \"Starting on Day 1, I will approve new drilling, new pipelines, new refiners, new power plants, new reactors, and we will slash the red tape.\" Trump's nominee to be Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, has put forth what he calls a [3-3-3 plan](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/treasury-secretary-nominee-scott-bessents-3-3-3-plan-what-know), increasing US oil and gas production by the equivalent of 3 million barrels of oil a day. Additionally, Doug Bergum, Trump's nominee for Secretary of the Interior, [has promised](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/dec/01/doug-burgum-trump-interior-secretary-drilling) to open up federally-protected lands to expedited oil and gas drilling permits.\n\nHowever, OilPrice.com [reports](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Exxon-Pours-Cold-Water-On-Trumps-Drill-Baby-Drill-Plans.html) that it might not be this simple, quoting Exxon’s Upstream President Liam Mallon  and TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanne as saying it is more likely that oil producers, due to a looming surplus of oil in 2025 combined with a need to maximize shareholder returns on capital, may throttle new production in order to avoid price destruction.\n\nAccording to the Financial Times ([‘Drill, baby, drill’ is not so simple](https://www.ft.com/content/90468253-0560-4cb2-a302-2e8636234265)), a key factor will be oil prices. A Kansas City Fed survey of energy firms found that a price of \\$89/barrel was needed for drilling to substantially increase, while oil prices as of January 2025 have been on a downswing:\n\n![Price history](https://metaculus-web-media.s3.amazonaws.com/user_uploaded/Screenshot_2024-12-05_at_2.40.51%C3%A2PM.png)\n\nAccording to Baker Hughes in its recent [annual report](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1701605/000170160524000033/bkr-20231231.htm):\n\n> The Baker Hughes rig counts are an important business barometer for the drilling industry and its suppliers. When drilling rigs are active they consume products and services produced by the oil service industry. Rig count trends are driven by the exploration and development spending by oil and natural gas companies, which in turn is influenced by current and future price expectations for oil and natural gas. The counts may reflect the relative strength and stability of energy prices and overall market activity; however, these counts should not be solely relied on as other specific and pervasive conditions may exist that affect overall energy prices and market activity.\n\n> We have been providing rig counts to the public since 1944. We gather all relevant data through our field service personnel, who obtain the necessary data from routine visits to the various rigs, customers, contractors and other outside sources as necessary. We base the classification of a well as either oil or natural gas primarily upon filings made by operators in the relevant jurisdiction. This data is then compiled and distributed to various wire services and trade associations and is published on our website. We believe the counting process and resulting data is reliable; however, it is subject to our ability to obtain accurate and timely information. Rig counts are compiled weekly for the U.S. and Canada and monthly for all international rigs. Published international rig counts do not include rigs drilling in certain locations, such as onshore China because this information is not readily available.\n\n> Rigs in the U.S. and Canada are counted as active if, on the day the count is taken, the well being drilled has been started but drilling has not been completed and the well is anticipated to be of sufficient depth to be a potential consumer of our drill bits. In international areas, rigs are counted on a weekly basis and deemed active if drilling activities occurred during the majority of the week. The weekly results are then averaged for the month and published accordingly. The rig count does not include rigs that are in transit from one location to another, rigging up, being used in non-drilling activities including production testing, completion and workover, and are not expected to be significant consumers of drill bits.\n\nAccording to the rig count [FAQ](https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/rig-count-faqs), data is published each Friday at noon central US time. Recent reports have found the following rig count numbers:\n\n| Date               | Value | Date              | Value |\n| ------------------ | ----- | ----------------- | ----- |\n| January 31, 2025   | 582   | July 5, 2024      | 585   |\n| January 24, 2025   | 576   | June 28, 2024     | 581   |\n| January 17, 2025   | 580   | June 21, 2024     | 588   |\n| January 10, 2025   | 584   | June 14, 2024     | 590   |\n| January 3, 2025    | 589   | June 7, 2024      | 594   |\n| December 27, 2024  | 589   | May 31, 2024      | 600   |\n| December 20, 2024  | 589   | May 24, 2024      | 600   |\n| December 13, 2024  | 589   | May 17, 2024      | 604   |\n| December 6, 2024   | 589   | May 10, 2024      | 603   |\n| November 27, 2024  | 582   | May 3, 2024       | 605   |\n| November 22, 2024  | 583   | April 26, 2024    | 613   |\n| November 15, 2024  | 584   | April 19, 2024    | 619   |\n| November 8, 2024   | 585   | April 12, 2024    | 617   |\n| November 1, 2024   | 585   | April 5, 2024     | 620   |\n| October 25, 2024   | 585   | March 28, 2024    | 621   |\n| October 18, 2024   | 585   | March 22, 2024    | 624   |\n| October 11, 2024   | 586   | March 15, 2024    | 629   |\n| October 4, 2024    | 585   | March 8, 2024     | 622   |\n| September 27, 2024 | 587   | March 1, 2024     | 629   |\n| September 20, 2024 | 588   | February 23, 2024 | 626   |\n| September 13, 2024 | 590   | February 16, 2024 | 621   |\n| September 6, 2024  | 582   | February 9, 2024  | 623   |\n| August 30, 2024    | 583   | February 2, 2024  | 619   |\n| August 23, 2024    | 585   | January 26, 2024  | 621   |\n| August 16, 2024    | 586   | January 19, 2024  | 620   |\n| August 9, 2024     | 588   | January 12, 2024  | 619   |\n| August 2, 2024     | 586   | January 5, 2024   | 621   |\n| July 26, 2024      | 589   | December 29, 2023 | 622   |\n| July 19, 2024      | 586   | December 21, 2023 | 620   |\n| July 12, 2024      | 584   |                   |       |\nResolution criteria: This question resolves as YES if the last count of active US drilling rigs for the week ending March 28, 2025, according to the Baker Hughes North America Rig Count, is between 570 and 574 inclusive.

We expect global oil inventories will fall in the second quarter of 2025 (2Q25) in part due to decreasing crude oil production in Iran and Venezuela. As a result, the Brent crude oil spot price in our forecast rises from about $70 per barrel (b) to $75/b by 3Q25. However, we expect oil inventories will build and place downward pressure on crude oil prices in late-2025 and through 2026 when we expect[OPEC+ unwinds production cuts](https://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/press_room/7477.htm)and[non-OPEC oil production grows](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=64565). As a result, we forecast the Brent crude oil price will fall to an average of $68/b in 2026.\\n\\n**Natural gas consumption and inventories.**Cold weather during January and February led to more consumption of natural gas and large withdrawals of natural gas from inventories. We now expect natural gas inventories to fall below 1.7 trillion cubic feet at the end of March, which is 10% below the previous five-year average and 6% less natural gas in storage than we had expected last month. We also increased our forecast for overall electricity generation over the next two years. As a result, we now expect the electric power sector will use more than 36 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas on average in 2025 and 2026, 2% and 1% more, respectively, than last month. Overall, we expect natural gas in storage to be 4% lower in 2025 and 3% lower in 2026 compared with what we had forecast last month.\\n\\n**Natural gas prices.**Because we now expect more consumption of natural gas in 2025 and 2026 and less natural gas in storge, we have raised our forecast Henry Hub spot price. We expect the Henry Hub price will average around $4.20 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in 2025, 11% more than last month\\u2019s forecast. We expect the annual average price in 2026 will be near $4.50/MMBtu, up 8% from last month.\\n\\n**Electricity consumption.**We expect total U.S. electricity sales will increase by 3% in 2025, led by strong growth in th\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 391 words out of ~901.

      "content": "Based on the gathered information, here is the analysis:\n\n1. **Current Rig Count**: As of March 14, 2025, the total number of active US drilling rigs is 592. The rig count has remained stable at this number for the weeks ending March 7 and March 14, 2025. This indicates a stable trend slightly above the target range of 570 to 574.\n\n2. **Oil Prices**: The EIA forecasts that the Brent crude oil spot price will rise from about $70 per barrel to $75 per barrel by the third quarter of 2025. However, oil prices are currently on a downswing, which may affect future drilling activity. Lower oil prices could lead to reduced drilling if companies do not find it economically viable to maintain or increase rig counts.\n\n3. **Policy Changes**: The Trump administration has issued directives to roll back regulations on the oil and gas sector and accelerate drilling and pipeline development. However, these efforts face legal challenges, and market forces such as energy prices may deter companies from increasing drilling.\n\n4. **Market Forces**: Despite government efforts to increase production, energy prices and other market forces may deter energy companies from increasing drilling. The current rig count is stable and above the target range, and there is no strong indication of a significant decrease in the immediate future.\n\nGiven these factors, the probability that the number of active US drilling rigs will be between 570 and 574 on March 28, 2025, is relatively low. The current rig count is stable at 592, and while there are factors that could lead to a decrease, the target range is quite specific and lower than current levels.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.15"
