  "question": "Will the United States impose any new tariffs on India before April 1, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.1,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered information, here are the key points relevant to the question of whether the United States will impose new tariffs on India before April 1, 2025:\n\n1. **U.S.-India COMPACT Initiative**: During Prime Minister Modi's visit to Washington, DC in February 2025, the US and India launched the 'U.S.-India COMPACT' initiative to drive transformative change across key pillars of cooperation, including trade and investment. This suggests a cooperative and positive approach towards trade relations.\n\n2. **Bilateral Trade Goals**: The US and India have set a new goal for bilateral trade, 'Mission 500', aiming to more than double total bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030, with the first tranche of a Bilateral Trade Agreement expected by fall 2025. This indicates a focus on expanding trade rather than imposing restrictions.\n\n3. **Strong Bipartisan Support**: India-US relations enjoy strong bipartisan support in the US Congress, with the India Caucus being one of the largest single country caucuses in the US Congress, comprising more than 100 members. This support is likely to favor maintaining and enhancing trade relations rather than imposing tariffs.\n\n4. **High-Level Trade Discussions**: Commerce and Industry Minister Shri Piyush Goyal visited Washington D.C. in March 2025, indicating ongoing high-level trade discussions and cooperation between the two countries.\n\nGiven the positive trajectory of trade relations, the cooperative initiatives, and the lack of any recent announcements or indications of new tariffs specifically targeting India, it seems unlikely that the US will impose new tariffs on India before April 1, 2025.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1",

      "content": "Based on the gathered information, here are the key points relevant to the question of whether the United States will impose new tariffs on India before April 1, 2025:\n\n1. **U.S.-India COMPACT Initiative**: During Prime Minister Modi's visit to Washington, DC in February 2025, the US and India launched the 'U.S.-India COMPACT' initiative to drive transformative change across key pillars of cooperation, including trade and investment. This suggests a cooperative and positive approach towards trade relations.\n\n2. **Bilateral Trade Goals**: The US and India have set a new goal for bilateral trade, 'Mission 500', aiming to more than double total bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030, with the first tranche of a Bilateral Trade Agreement expected by fall 2025. This indicates a focus on expanding trade rather than imposing restrictions.\n\n3. **Strong Bipartisan Support**: India-US relations enjoy strong bipartisan support in the US Congress, with the India Caucus being one of the largest single country caucuses in the US Congress, comprising more than 100 members. This support is likely to favor maintaining and enhancing trade relations rather than imposing tariffs.\n\n4. **High-Level Trade Discussions**: Commerce and Industry Minister Shri Piyush Goyal visited Washington D.C. in March 2025, indicating ongoing high-level trade discussions and cooperation between the two countries.\n\nGiven the positive trajectory of trade relations, the cooperative initiatives, and the lack of any recent announcements or indications of new tariffs specifically targeting India, it seems unlikely that the US will impose new tariffs on India before April 1, 2025.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1"
