  "question": "Will Cathy Harris still be listed as chairing the Merit Systems Protection Board on March 31, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.7,
  "reasoning": "I was unable to find specific recent information regarding Cathy Harris's status as the chair of the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) as of March 2025. The search did not yield any direct results about her current status or any official announcements regarding changes in leadership at the MSPB.\n\nHowever, the \"Political Appointee Tracker\" by the Partnership for Public Service and The Washington Post tracks nominees for critical leadership roles, including those requiring Senate confirmation. This resource could potentially provide updates on any changes in political appointments, but the content fetched did not specifically mention Cathy Harris or any changes related to her position.\n\nGiven the lack of specific information indicating a change in her status, and assuming no significant events have occurred to suggest otherwise, I would estimate the probability that Cathy Harris will still be listed as chairing the MSPB on March 31, 2025, to be moderately high.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.7",
