  "question": "Will \"High Tide\" win the 2025 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Film -- Limited Release?",
  "probability": 0.1,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered information, \"High Tide\" is indeed nominated for the Outstanding Film – Limited Theatrical Release category at the 2025 GLAAD Media Awards. The nominees in this category include:\n\n- 20,000 Species of Bees\n- Backspot\n- Before I Change My Mind\n- Big Boys\n- Close to You\n- Crossing\n- Fitting In\n- High Tide\n- Housekeeping for Beginners\n- A Place of Our Own\n\nThe GLAAD Media Awards evaluate nominees based on criteria such as fair, accurate, and inclusive representations of the LGBTQ community, boldness and originality, significant cultural impact, and overall quality. The final decision is made by a review panel after considering the votes from over 700 voters and volunteers.\n\nWhile \"High Tide\" is among the nominees, there is no specific information available about expert predictions or the likelihood of its win compared to the other nominees. Given that it is one of ten nominees, and assuming no additional information about its relative strength or weakness compared to the others, a rough estimate of its probability of winning could be around 0.1 (10%).\n\nHowever, considering the nature of awards and the subjective criteria involved, this is a very rough estimate and should be taken with caution.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1",
