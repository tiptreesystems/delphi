  "question": "Will I Kissed a Girl win the 2025 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Reality Competition Program?",
  "probability": 0.3,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, \"I Kissed a Girl\" is indeed nominated for the Outstanding Reality Competition Program at the 36th Annual GLAAD Media Awards. It is competing against well-known shows such as \"RuPaul’s Drag Race,\" \"The Amazing Race,\" and \"Top Chef.\" The GLAAD Media Awards evaluate nominees based on criteria such as fair, accurate, and inclusive representations of the LGBTQ community, boldness and originality, cultural impact, and overall quality. The results are determined by over 700 GLAAD Media Award voters and volunteers, certified by a Review Panel.\n\nGiven the competitive nature of the category and the presence of strong contenders like \"RuPaul’s Drag Race,\" which has a history of winning such awards, the probability of \"I Kissed a Girl\" winning is influenced by these factors.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.3",
