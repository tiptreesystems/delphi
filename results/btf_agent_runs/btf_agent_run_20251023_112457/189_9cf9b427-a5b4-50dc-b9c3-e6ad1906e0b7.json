  "question": "Will the difference between the Arena Score of o3 and the next best model on Chatbot Arena be between 5.0 and 15.0 on April 5, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.1,
  "reasoning": "Based on the information gathered from the Chatbot Arena leaderboard as of March 20, 2025, the following key points are relevant to estimating the probability of the question:\n\n1. **Current Rankings**: The highest-ranked model on the Chatbot Arena leaderboard is GPT-4.5-Preview with an Arena Elo score of 1404.\n\n2. **o3 Model Performance**: The o3-mini-high model has an Arena Elo score of 1325, and the o3-mini model has an Arena Elo score of 1304. These scores are significantly lower than the top-ranked models.\n\n3. **Score Range**: The top models have scores ranging from 1404 to 1304, with several models closely clustered in the 1300-1400 range.\n\n4. **Performance Claims**: OpenAI announced the o3 model on December 20, 2024, claiming it performs significantly better in math, coding, and various benchmarks than all currently released models. However, the current leaderboard does not reflect this superiority in terms of Arena Elo scores.\n\nGiven the current standings and the fact that o3 models are not leading the leaderboard, the probability that the difference between the Arena Score of o3 and the next best model will be between 5.0 and 15.0 on April 5, 2025, seems low. The o3 models are currently not close enough to the top-ranked models to achieve such a difference within the given time frame.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1",

GPT-4.5 is a step forward in scaling up pretraining and post-training. By scaling unsupervised learning, GPT-4.5 improves its ability to recognize patterns, draw connections, and generate creative insights without reasoning.\n\n\nEarly testing shows that interacting with GPT-4.5 feels more natural. Its broader knowledge base, improved ability to follow user intent, and greater “EQ” make it useful for tasks like improving writing, programming, and solving practical problems. We also expect it to hallucinate less.\n\n\nWe’re sharing GPT-4.5 as a research preview to better understand its strengths and limitations. We’re still exploring what it’s capable of and are eager to see how people use it in ways we might not have expected.\n\n\n**Introducing OpenAI o3-mini (January 31, 2025)**\n\nWe’re excited to release o3-mini, our newest cost-efficient reasoning model optimized for coding, math, and science.\n\n\nOn the API, o3-mini supports Structured Outputs, function calling, developer messages, and streaming. It offers three adjustable reasoning efforts (low, medium, and high), so you can balance speed with depth for your use case.\n\n\nChatGPT Team, Pro, Plus, and Free plan users can access o3-mini starting today. Additionally, o3-mini now works with search to find up-to-date answers with links to relevant web sources. This is an early prototype as we work to integrate search across our reasoning models.In side-by-side testing, o3-mini delivered results on par with o1 at a lower latency, and outperformed o1-mini on advanced STEM tasks.\n\nExpert evaluators preferred o3-mini’s answers 56% of the time over o1-mini’s, citing improved clarity and fewer critical errors on difficult questions. We look forward to your feedback and will keep refining o3-mini as we expand our family of advanced reasoning models.\n\n\n**Updates to GPT-4o in ChatGPT (January 29, 2025)**\n\nWe’ve made some updates to GPT-4o–it’s now a smarter model across the board with more up-to-date knowledge, as well as deeper understanding and analysis of image uploads.\n\n\n**More up-to-date knowledge:** By extending its training data cutoff from November 2023 to June 2024, GPT-4o can now offer more relevant,…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 364 words out of ~1251.

GPT-4.5 is a step forward in scaling up pretraining and post-training. By scaling unsupervised learning, GPT-4.5 improves its ability to recognize patterns, draw connections, and generate creative insights without reasoning.\n\n\nEarly testing shows that interacting with GPT-4.5 feels more natural. Its broader knowledge base, improved ability to follow user intent, and greater “EQ” make it useful for tasks like improving writing, programming, and solving practical problems. We also expect it to hallucinate less.\n\n\nWe’re sharing GPT-4.5 as a research preview to better understand its strengths and limitations. We’re still exploring what it’s capable of and are eager to see how people use it in ways we might not have expected.\n\n\n**Introducing OpenAI o3-mini (January 31, 2025)**\n\nWe’re excited to release o3-mini, our newest cost-efficient reasoning model optimized for coding, math, and science.\n\n\nOn the API, o3-mini supports Structured Outputs, function calling, developer messages, and streaming. It offers three adjustable reasoning efforts (low, medium, and high), so you can balance speed with depth for your use case.\n\n\nChatGPT Team, Pro, Plus, and Free plan users can access o3-mini starting today. Additionally, o3-mini now works with search to find up-to-date answers with links to relevant web sources. This is an early prototype as we work to integrate search across our reasoning models.In side-by-side testing, o3-mini delivered results on par with o1 at a lower latency, and outperformed o1-mini on advanced STEM tasks.\n\nExpert evaluators preferred o3-mini’s answers 56% of the time over o1-mini’s, citing improved clarity and fewer critical errors on difficult questions. We look forward to your feedback and will keep refining o3-mini as we expand our family of advanced reasoning models.\n\n\n**Updates to GPT-4o in ChatGPT (January 29, 2025)**\n\nWe’ve made some updates to GPT-4o–it’s now a smarter model across the board with more up-to-date knowledge, as well as deeper understanding and analysis of image uploads.\n\n\n**More up-to-date knowledge:** By extending its training data cutoff from November 2023 to June 2024, GPT-4o can now offer more relevant,…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 364 words out of ~1251.

GPT-4.5 is a step forward in scaling up pretraining and post-training. By scaling unsupervised learning, GPT-4.5 improves its ability to recognize patterns, draw connections, and generate creative insights without reasoning.\\n\\n\\nEarly testing shows that interacting with GPT-4.5 feels more natural. Its broader knowledge base, improved ability to follow user intent, and greater \\u201cEQ\\u201d make it useful for tasks like improving writing, programming, and solving practical problems. We also expect it to hallucinate less.\\n\\n\\nWe\\u2019re sharing GPT-4.5 as a research preview to better understand its strengths and limitations. We\\u2019re still exploring what it\\u2019s capable of and are eager to see how people use it in ways we might not have expected.\\n\\n\\n**Introducing OpenAI o3-mini (January 31, 2025)**\\n\\nWe\\u2019re excited to release o3-mini, our newest cost-efficient reasoning model optimized for coding, math, and science.\\n\\n\\nOn the API, o3-mini supports Structured Outputs, function calling, developer messages, and streaming. It offers three adjustable reasoning efforts (low, medium, and high), so you can balance speed with depth for your use case.\\n\\n\\nChatGPT Team, Pro, Plus, and Free plan users can access o3-mini starting today. Additionally, o3-mini now works with search to find up-to-date answers with links to relevant web sources. This is an early prototype as we work to integrate search across our reasoning models.In side-by-side testing, o3-mini delivered results on par with o1 at a lower latency, and outperformed o1-mini on advanced STEM tasks.\\n\\nExpert evaluators preferred o3-mini\\u2019s answers 56% of the time over o1-mini\\u2019s, citing improved clarity and fewer critical errors on difficult questions. We look forward to your feedback and will keep refining o3-mini as we expand our family of advanced reasoning models.\\n\\n\\n**Updates to GPT-4o in ChatGPT (January 29, 2025)**\\n\\nWe\\u2019ve made some updates to GPT-4o\\u2013it\\u2019s now a smarter model across the board with more up-to-date knowledge, as well as deeper understanding and analysis of image uploads.\\n\\n\\n**More up-to-date knowledge:** By extending its training data cutoff from November 2023 to June 2024, GPT-4o can now offer more relevant,\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 364 words out of ~1251.

These scores are significantly lower than the top-ranked models.\n\n3. **Score Range**: The top models have scores ranging from 1404 to 1304, with several models closely clustered in the 1300-1400 range.\n\n4. **Performance Claims**: OpenAI announced the o3 model on December 20, 2024, claiming it performs significantly better in math, coding, and various benchmarks than all currently released models. However, the current leaderboard does not reflect this superiority in terms of Arena Elo scores.\n\nGiven the current standings and the fact that o3 models are not leading the leaderboard, the probability that the difference between the Arena Score of o3 and the next best model will be between 5.0 and 15.0 on April 5, 2025, seems low. The o3 models are currently not close enough to the top-ranked models to achieve such a difference within the given time frame.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1"
