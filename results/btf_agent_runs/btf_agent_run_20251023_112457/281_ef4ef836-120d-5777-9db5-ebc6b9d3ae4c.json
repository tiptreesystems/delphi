  "question": "Will the \"datascience\" subreddit have between 2,685,000 and 2,750,000 subscribers on March 30, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.65,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered information, here are some key points to consider for estimating the probability that the \"datascience\" subreddit will have between 2,685,000 and 2,750,000 subscribers on March 30, 2025:\n\n1. **Reddit's Growth**: Reddit has been experiencing significant growth, with its monthly active user base growing by 48.15% since 2022, reaching 1.36 billion in 2025. This indicates a healthy growth environment for subreddits, including \"datascience\".\n\n2. **Subreddit Popularity**: Among the top 10 subreddits, the largest has 66 million members, suggesting that popular subreddits can achieve large subscriber bases. While \"datascience\" is not among the absolute largest, it is a consistently growing subreddit.\n\n3. **Platform Challenges**: Reddit faces challenges such as increased competition from platforms like TikTok and Discord, more advertising, and algorithm-driven feeds. These factors could potentially impact user engagement and growth rates.\n\n4. **Data Reliability**: The data from subredditstats.com is not robust due to changes in Reddit's API pricing, which affects the accuracy of subscriber statistics. This makes it difficult to rely on precise numbers for forecasting.\n\n5. **Community Focus**: Despite challenges, Reddit's community-driven nature and strong moderation are likely to keep it a key player in the digital landscape, supporting ongoing growth for niche subreddits like \"datascience\".\n\nGiven these factors, the \"datascience\" subreddit is likely to continue growing, but the exact subscriber count is uncertain due to data reliability issues and external competition. However, the growth trends and Reddit's overall expansion suggest a reasonable probability that the subscriber count will fall within the specified range.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.65",

As of August 2021, the company was valued at $10 billion, following a recent funding round of $410 million.\n\nIn March 2024, Reddit went public and now has more than 365.4 million weekly active users.\n\nRead on to find all of the latest Reddit statistics in 2025.\n\n## Reddit Stats (Top Picks)\n\n- Reddit has\n**97.2 million**daily active users. - Reddit has\n**365.4 million**weekly active users. - There are more than\n**100,000**active subreddits on the platform. - Reddit registered\n**$872.5 million**in annual revenue in Q1-Q3 2024.\n\n## Reddit Daily Active Users\n\nAccording to company-published data, Reddit has **97.2 million** daily active unique visitors worldwide as of Q3 2024. Reddit’s daily active user count has grown by 47.27% since Q3 2023.\n\nWe’ve charted Reddit’s daily active user growth since Q1 2021:\n\n| Date | Reddit Daily Active Users |\n|---|---|\n| Q1 2021 | 54.8 million |\n| Q2 2021 | 54.0 million |\n| Q3 2021 | 53.6 million |\n| Q4 2021 | 53.9 million |\n| Q1 2022 | 57.5 million |\n| Q2 2022 | 56.5 million |\n| Q3 2022 | 57.3 million |\n| Q4 2022 | 57.5 million |\n| Q1 2023 | 60.3 million |\n| Q2 2023 | 60.4 million |\n| Q3 2023 | 66.0 million |\n| Q4 2023 | 73.1 million |\n| Q1 2024 | 82.7 million |\n| Q2 2024 | 91.2 million |\n| Q3 2024 | 97.2 million |\n\nOut of 97.2 million Reddit daily active users, **44.1 million** were users with registered accounts on Reddit accounting for 45.37% of all unique visitors.\n\nHere’s a detailed breakdown of Reddit’s unique visitors by logged-in and logged-out users since Q1 2021:\n\n| Date | Reddit Logged-in Users | Reddit Logged-out Users |\n|---|---|---|\n| Q1 2021 | 23.3 million | 31.5 million |\n| Q2 2021 | 24.0 million | 30.0 million |\n| Q3 2021 | 24.4 million | 29.2 million |\n| Q4 2021 | 25.7 million | 28.2 million |\n| Q1 2022 | 27.6 million | 29.9 million |\n| Q2 2022 | 28.2 million | 28.3 million |\n| Q3 2022 | 29.2 million | 28.1 million |\n| Q4 2022 | 30.0 million | 27.5 million |\n|…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 446 words out of ~2216.

You can click a subreddit name to see stats (graphs, etc.) for that subreddit. Click on the link icon next to the subreddit's name to go directly to the subreddit. You might also like to check out some network visualisations of subreddit relationships, or analyse user/commenter overlaps between subreddits, or track keyword frequencies over time in reddit comments. Caution: Please do not rely on the accuracy of this site's data for anything serious/important - the data collector is not robust, and so the numbers should only be used as a general guide.\n\nHeads up! This data is likely out of date or inaccurate now that Reddit has decided to kill the open ecosystem that existed around Reddit. I don't earn any money from this site, and if my calculations are correct it'd cost me a couple thousand dollars per month with their new API pricing, so yeah. If you can, it's probably worth leaving Reddit for other platforms - especially open-source/federated ones like Lemmy.\n\nNote 1: People are sometimes confused by the fact that there are multiple Lemmy websites like lemmy.world and lemmy.ml - don't worry about that. Just sign up on one site, and you'll be able to join and interact with communities on any other Lemmy site. Choosing which Lemmy site to sign up to is a bit like choosing your email provider - e.g. if you use gmail, you can still communicate with people who use other email services like yahoo or protonmail. The reason there are multiple sites is because anyone can create their own Lemmy instance - so no single person or company controls the 'fediverse'. Just choose a popular and reputable one like lemmy.world.\n\nNote 2: You can use lemmyverse.net to help you find communities across the whole fediverse. If you've signed up to lemmy.world, then you can visit 'local' communities like lemmy.world/c/memes - and if you want to subscribe to or interact with a community on a different site, then just add @SiteName to the end of the community URL. For example, if you're signed up to lemmy.world, but you prefer the lemmy.ml memes community, then you can visit lemmy.world/c/memes@lemmy.ml to subscribe to and interact with the lemmy.ml memes community.\n\nNote 3: Lemmy is based on the same technology as Mastodon.

With over 57 million daily active users engaging across thousands of niche subreddits, it provides a unique space for discussions, reviews, and organic content. However, as digital trends evolve, many are questioning whether Reddit will maintain its relevance in 2025. Here, we explore the factors shaping Reddit’s future and how brands can adapt to maximise their impact on the platform.\n\n**The Evolution of Reddit’s Relevance**\n\nReddit’s enduring popularity lies in its ability to provide value to a broad spectrum of users. Whether it’s students looking for academic advice, professionals discussing industry trends, or hobbyists sharing expertise, Reddit has fostered a strong culture of knowledge-sharing and community. However, its growth has not been without challenges:\n\n**Increased Competition:**Platforms like TikTok and Discord have emerged as strong competitors, offering alternative spaces for niche communities and organic interactions. Reddit must innovate to keep users engaged.**Advertising and Monetisation:**Reddit’s push for profitability has led to more advertising on the platform. While this creates opportunities for brands, it risks alienating users who value the platform’s authentic, ad-light experience.**Algorithmic Changes:**Like many social platforms, Reddit has introduced algorithm-driven feeds, potentially impacting the visibility of organic content.\n\nDespite these challenges, Reddit’s unique structure and community focus suggest it’s likely to remain a key player in the digital landscape.\n\n**What Sets Reddit Apart?**\n\nReddit’s defining feature is its community-driven nature. Unlike other platforms, Reddit thrives on:\n\n**Strong Moderation:**Subreddit moderators enforce rules and maintain quality discussions, ensuring spaces remain valuable for users.**Niche Communities:**With over 100,000 active subreddits, users can find hi…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 331 words out of ~847.

You can click a subreddit name to see stats (graphs, etc.) for that subreddit. Click on the link icon next to the subreddit's name to go directly to the subreddit. You might also like to check out some network visualisations of subreddit relationships, or analyse user/commenter overlaps between subreddits, or track keyword frequencies over time in reddit comments. Caution: Please do not rely on the accuracy of this site's data for anything serious/important - the data collector is not robust, and so the numbers should only be used as a general guide.\\n\\nHeads up! This data is likely out of date or inaccurate now that Reddit has decided to kill the open ecosystem that existed around Reddit. I don't earn any money from this site, and if my calculations are correct it'd cost me a couple thousand dollars per month with their new API pricing, so yeah. If you can, it's probably worth leaving Reddit for other platforms - especially open-source/federated ones like Lemmy.\\n\\nNote 1: People are sometimes confused by the fact that there are multiple Lemmy websites like lemmy.world and lemmy.ml - don't worry about that. Just sign up on one site, and you'll be able to join and interact with communities on any other Lemmy site. Choosing which Lemmy site to sign up to is a bit like choosing your email provider - e.g. if you use gmail, you can still communicate with people who use other email services like yahoo or protonmail. The reason there are multiple sites is because anyone can create their own Lemmy instance - so no single person or company controls the 'fediverse'. Just choose a popular and reputable one like lemmy.world.\\n\\nNote 2: You can use lemmyverse.net to help you find communities across the whole fediverse. If you've signed up to lemmy.world, then you can visit 'local' communities like lemmy.world/c/memes - and if you want to subscribe to or interact with a community on a different site, then just add @SiteName to the end of the community URL. For example, if you're signed up to lemmy.world, but you prefer the lemmy.ml memes community, then you can visit lemmy.world/c/memes@lemmy.ml to subscribe to and interact with the lemmy.ml memes community.\\n\\nNote 3: Lemmy is based on the same technology as Mastodon.

With over 57 million daily active users engaging across thousands of niche subreddits, it provides a unique space for discussions, reviews, and organic content.

This indicates a healthy growth environment for subreddits, including \"datascience\".\n\n2. **Subreddit Popularity**: Among the top 10 subreddits, the largest has 66 million members, suggesting that popular subreddits can achieve large subscriber bases. While \"datascience\" is not among the absolute largest, it is a consistently growing subreddit.\n\n3. **Platform Challenges**: Reddit faces challenges such as increased competition from platforms like TikTok and Discord, more advertising, and algorithm-driven feeds. These factors could potentially impact user engagement and growth rates.\n\n4. **Data Reliability**: The data from subredditstats.com is not robust due to changes in Reddit's API pricing, which affects the accuracy of subscriber statistics. This makes it difficult to rely on precise numbers for forecasting.\n\n5. **Community Focus**: Despite challenges, Reddit's community-driven nature and strong moderation are likely to keep it a key player in the digital landscape, supporting ongoing growth for niche subreddits like \"datascience\".\n\nGiven these factors, the \"datascience\" subreddit is likely to continue growing, but the exact subscriber count is uncertain due to data reliability issues and external competition. However, the growth trends and Reddit's overall expansion suggest a reasonable probability that the subscriber count will fall within the specified range.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.65"
