  "question": "Will Russia have control of Chasiv Yar on February 28, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.9,
  "reasoning": "Based on the evidence gathered from various sources, here is the current situation regarding the control of Chasiv Yar as of late February 2025:\n\n1. **Russian Advances**: Russian forces have captured most of Chasiv Yar, with reports indicating that as of early February 2025, 90% of the city is under Russian control. The battle for Chasiv Yar has been ongoing since April 2024, and Russian forces have made significant territorial gains over the past months.\n\n2. **Ukrainian Resistance**: Despite the Russian advances, Ukrainian forces maintain a presence in approximately 20% of Chasiv Yar. The Ukrainian military is committed to defending the city due to its strategic importance, although they are significantly outnumbered by Russian troops.\n\n3. **Strategic Importance**: Chasiv Yar is considered strategically important due to its elevation and its potential to provide Russia with a direct route to other key Ukrainian cities in the Donetsk region.\n\n4. **Current Military Situation**: The conflict is characterized by intense, close-quarters combat, with Ukrainian forces engaging in block-to-block fighting against Russian troops. Russian forces continue to press their offensive in the Donetsk region, including around Chasiv Yar.\n\nGiven the current control of the city and the ongoing military operations, it is highly likely that Russia will maintain control of Chasiv Yar on February 28, 2025.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.9",

Peace must be achieved at all costs, the U.S. president has said, while the Russian invasion continues and the pain is felt, above all, in the few towns in Donetsk province still under the control of free Ukraine. Seven kilometres (4.4 miles) from Kostiantynivka, Russian troops are stationed in neighbouring [Chasiv Yar](https://english.elpais.com/international/2024-05-20/the-five-fronts-ukraine-is-defending-with-troops-and-weapons-pushed-to-the-limit.html). “The Russians are lying, they don’t want peace, they want to destroy us,” says Jack, the code name of a young soldier from the 18th Brigade of the National Guard.\n\n“Putin is lying,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy told Trump on Thursday when the Republican assured him that the Russian autocrat wants peace. The Ukrainian soldiers in Chasiv Yar — many exhausted from years of fighting and losing comrades along the way — want peace more than anyone, but none trust Moscow.\n\nReports of Putin-Trump talks are also being discussed among Ukrainian soldiers.

Ukraine previously said that Russia aimed to capture the city by May 9 for its Victory Day holiday, which Russia failed to do. According to the Associated Press on June 25, 2024, the Russian military is making a new push for the area: Relentless Russian attacks on Ukrainian positions defending the strategically important eastern town of Chasiv Yar are disrupting troop rotations and the delivery of some supplies, soldiers in the area say. Russian troops are seeking to press their advantage in troop numbers and weaponry before Ukrainian forces are bulked up by promised new Western military aid that is already trickling to the front line, analysts say.\", \"resolution_criteria\": \"This question will resolve based on the status of these coordinates on the Institute for the Study of War's Ukraine Interactive War Map when accessed by Metaculus on or after February 28, 2025: 48°35'13.7\\\"N 37°50'02.1\\\"E If this point on the map is under Russian control on that date, this question will resolve as Yes.

      "content": "Based on the evidence gathered from various sources, here is the current situation regarding the control of Chasiv Yar as of late February 2025:\n\n1. **Russian Advances**: Russian forces have captured most of Chasiv Yar, with reports indicating that as of early February 2025, 90% of the city is under Russian control. The battle for Chasiv Yar has been ongoing since April 2024, and Russian forces have made significant territorial gains over the past months.\n\n2. **Ukrainian Resistance**: Despite the Russian advances, Ukrainian forces maintain a presence in approximately 20% of Chasiv Yar. The Ukrainian military is committed to defending the city due to its strategic importance, although they are significantly outnumbered by Russian troops.\n\n3. **Strategic Importance**: Chasiv Yar is considered strategically important due to its elevation and its potential to provide Russia with a direct route to other key Ukrainian cities in the Donetsk region.\n\n4. **Current Military Situation**: The conflict is characterized by intense, close-quarters combat, with Ukrainian forces engaging in block-to-block fighting against Russian troops. Russian forces continue to press their offensive in the Donetsk region, including around Chasiv Yar.\n\nGiven the current control of the city and the ongoing military operations, it is highly likely that Russia will maintain control of Chasiv Yar on February 28, 2025.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.9"
