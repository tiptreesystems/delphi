  "question": "Will Israel lift the blockade to humanitarian aid into Gaza before April 7, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.1,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here is the current situation regarding the blockade of humanitarian aid into Gaza:\n\n1. **Current Blockade Status**: Since March 2, 2025, Israel has blocked all humanitarian aid, including fuel, from entering Gaza. This action is in violation of international humanitarian law, as reported by multiple sources including Human Rights Watch and ReliefWeb.\n\n2. **Humanitarian Impact**: The blockade has caused significant distress in Gaza, with reports of food supplies running out and medical facilities being overwhelmed. The World Food Programme warned that food supplies for public kitchens and bakeries would run out in less than two weeks if aid is not allowed in.\n\n3. **Ceasefire Collapse**: On March 17, 2025, Israel unilaterally ended the ceasefire with Hamas and resumed air strikes on Gaza. This has further complicated the situation and hindered any progress towards resuming aid.\n\n4. **International Response**: The blockade and resumption of hostilities have been condemned by the UN, several countries, and international human rights organizations. There is significant international pressure on Israel to lift the blockade and allow humanitarian aid to resume.\n\n5. **Diplomatic Efforts**: Despite international condemnation and legal orders from bodies like the International Court of Justice, there has been no indication of a breakthrough in negotiations or a change in Israel's stance regarding the blockade.\n\nGiven the current situation, the probability of Israel lifting the blockade and allowing humanitarian aid into Gaza before April 7, 2025, seems low. The ongoing military operations, the collapse of the ceasefire, and the lack of progress in diplomatic negotiations suggest that the blockade is likely to continue in the short term.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1",

Even during the ceasefire period, Israel also continued its attacks and has imposed blockade on Gaza since March 2, albeit at a lower scale. Between 19 January and 17 March, during the ceasefire, Israel had killed at least 170 Gazans and allowed only 70% of the 600 aid trucks to be allowed in daily (AJ 18/03/2025 a). The 17 March air strikes killed at least 404 civilians (170 children and 80 women) and injured around 660. On 20 March, Israel launched additional air strikes and resumed ground operations, killing around 91 Palestinians and wounding dozens (Reuters 20/03/2025 and 18/03/2025; OCHA 18/03/2025 a; The Guardian 18/03/2025). On Monday 24 March, Israel launched several strikes killing at least 65 civilians, including children and journalists, the attacks have been registered in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, Beit Lahiya and attacks to the Red Cross building in Rafah (The Guardian 24/03/2025; France24 24/03/2025).\n\nUntil 25 March, many bodies had not been retrieved from under rubble. The death toll continues to rise as injured individuals fail to receive access to essential medicine because of Israel’s most recent and longest blockade on Gaza since 2 March. Medical facilities are also overwhelmed, with many destroyed, rendering them unable to provide adequate treatment (OCHA 18/03/2025 a; The Guardian 18/03/2025).

This flagrantly breaches international law and any prospects of peace, they said. The experts issued the following joint statement:\n\n“We are alarmed by Israel’s decision to suspend once again all goods and supplies, including life-saving humanitarian aid entering the Gaza strip. The announcement followed a decision by the Israeli War Cabinet to break from the Gaza ceasefire agreement and calls by ministers to re-open the ‘gates of hell’ in the besieged enclave.\n\nApart from the cruelty of these statements on the second day of the holy month of Ramadan, these moves are patently unlawful under international law. As the occupying Power, Israel is always obliged to ensure sufficient food, medical supplies and other relief services. By deliberately cutting vital supplies, including those relating to sexual and reproductive health, and assistive devices for persons with disabilities, Israel is once again weaponising aid. These are serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights laws, and war crimes and crimes against humanity under the Rome Statute.\n\nThe so-called three phase ceasefire deal should have led to a permanent cessation of hostilities and the release of all Palestinians and Israelis unlawfully detained as a most basic requisite for sustainable peace. Instead, they resulted in further violence and even further destruction of Palestinian life. This is both unlawful and utterly inhumane.\n\nDuring the ceasefire, conditions remained…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 356 words out of ~1343. Full content available via `btf_extract_evidence`.]"

Even during the ceasefire period, Israel also continued its attacks and has imposed blockade on Gaza since March 2, albeit at a lower scale. Between 19 January and 17 March, during the ceasefire, Israel had killed at least 170 Gazans and allowed only 70% of the 600 aid trucks to be allowed in daily (AJ 18/03/2025 a). The 17 March air strikes killed at least 404 civilians (170 children and 80 women) and injured around 660. On 20 March, Israel launched additional air strikes and resumed ground operations, killing around 91 Palestinians and wounding dozens (Reuters 20/03/2025 and 18/03/2025; OCHA 18/03/2025 a; The Guardian 18/03/2025). On Monday 24 March, Israel launched several strikes killing at least 65 civilians, including children and journalists, the attacks have been registered in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, Beit Lahiya and attacks to the Red Cross building in Rafah (The Guardian 24/03/2025; France24 24/03/2025).\n\nUntil 25 March, many bodies had not been retrieved from under rubble. The death toll continues to rise as injured individuals fail to receive access to essential medicine because of Israel’s most recent and longest blockade on Gaza since 2 March. Medical facilities are also overwhelmed, with many destroyed, rendering them unable to provide adequate treatment (OCHA 18/03/2025 a; The Guardian 18/03/2025).

Even during the ceasefire period, Israel also continued its attacks and has imposed blockade on Gaza since March 2, albeit at a lower scale. Between 19 January and 17 March, during the ceasefire, Israel had killed at least 170 Gazans and allowed only 70% of the 600 aid trucks to be allowed in daily (AJ 18/03/2025 a). The 17 March air strikes killed at least 404 civilians (170 children and 80 women) and injured around 660. On 20 March, Israel launched additional air strikes and resumed ground operations, killing around 91 Palestinians and wounding dozens (Reuters 20/03/2025 and 18/03/2025; OCHA 18/03/2025 a; The Guardian 18/03/2025). On Monday 24 March, Israel launched several strikes killing at least 65 civilians, including children and journalists, the attacks have been registered in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, Beit Lahiya and attacks to the Red Cross building in Rafah (The Guardian 24/03/2025; France24 24/03/2025).\\n\\nUntil 25 March, many bodies had not been retrieved from under rubble. The death toll continues to rise as injured individuals fail to receive access to essential medicine because of Israel\\u2019s most recent and longest blockade on Gaza since 2 March. Medical facilities are also overwhelmed, with many destroyed, rendering them unable to provide adequate treatment (OCHA 18/03/2025 a; The Guardian 18/03/2025). With the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) specifically targeting hospitals and healthcare workers since October 2023, causing Gaza\\u2019s health system to collapse completely, leaving it without any capacity even before the ceasefire (Insecurity Insight 06/11/2024).\\n\\nUntil 25 March 2025, no safe zones had been established. At the same time, the IDF also attacked previously designated safe areas before the ceasefire, and the recent air strikes hit Al Mawa\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 366 words out of ~673.

The deal would consist of three phases, each lasting 6 weeks. In the first phase, Hamas [released 25 hostages and the bodies of 8 more](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-remaining-hostages-gaza-dbedb436b04fac1c790a794a4ef03853), while Israel released hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Israel also allowed humanitarian aid to enter Gaza, [25,000 trucks](https://x.com/gidonsaar/status/1897280908450836820) according to Israel's Minister of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe original plan was that, in the second phase, Hamas would release all remaining alive male Israelis and Israel would release an agreed upon number of Palestinian prisoners, while the parties would also agree to a withdrawal of remaining Israeli soldiers from the Gaza Strip and a more permanent cessation of hostilities. Then, in the third phase, both Israel and Hamas would release all the remaining bodies of dead captives, Israel would end the [blockade of the Gaza Strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_of_the_Gaza_Strip \"Blockade of the Gaza Strip\"), and Hamas would not rebuild its military capabilities.\n\nHowever, after the end of the first phase, on March 2, 2025, Israel [halted](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckgz7p85mdgo) all humanitarian aid and goods from entering Gaza, with the goal of pressuring Hamas into accepting a new agreement, backed by the United States. This would extend the first phase for seven more weeks and would involve Hamas releasing half of the remaining hostages.\n\nAfter the blockade, prices for essentials like sugar, oil, and chicken [rose significantly](https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-aid-cutoff-netanyahu-hunger-war-940ceea2c2b754d197a4f07c0cad86de). The UN called the blockade [alarming](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israel-hamas-gaza-aid-barred-ceasefire-talks-criticized-un-red-cross-rcna194464) and condemned it along with [UK, France, and Germany](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/05/uk-france-germany-israel-gaza-aid-freeze-could-breach-international-law), citing violations of humanitarian law that mandates aid access. Hamas [has insisted](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/02/world/middleeast/israel-aid-halt-gaza.html) on moving to the agreed second phase of the ceasefire, which would involve a full Israeli withdrawal and a permanent end to the conflict.\nResolution criteria: This question will resolve as **Yes** if, before April 7, 2025, humanitarian aid into Gaza has resumed, according to credible sources.\nFine print: \npresent_date: 2025-03-27T02:30:02.777787\n\n\nMake sure to use the tools at your disposal to gather relevant information before providing your final probability estimate.\n\nYou may reason through the problem, but you MUST end your response with:\nFINAL PROBABILITY: [your decimal number between 0 and 1]"

Even during the ceasefire period, Israel also continued its attacks and has imposed blockade on Gaza since March 2, albeit at a lower scale. Between 19 January and 17 March, during the ceasefire, Israel had killed at least 170 Gazans and allowed only 70% of the 600 aid trucks to be allowed in daily (AJ 18/03/2025 a). The 17 March air strikes killed at least 404 civilians (170 children and 80 women) and injured around 660. On 20 March, Israel launched additional air strikes and resumed ground operations, killing around 91 Palestinians and wounding dozens (Reuters 20/03/2025 and 18/03/2025; OCHA 18/03/2025 a; The Guardian 18/03/2025). On Monday 24 March, Israel launched several strikes killing at least 65 civilians, including children and journalists, the attacks have been registered in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, Beit Lahiya and attacks to the Red Cross building in Rafah (The Guardian 24/03/2025; France24 24/03/2025).\\n\\nUntil 25 March, many bodies had not been retrieved from under rubble. The death toll continues to rise as injured individuals fail to receive access to essential medicine because of Israel\\u2019s most recent and longest blockade on Gaza since 2 March. Medical facilities are also overwhelmed, with many destroyed, rendering them unable to provide adequate treatment (OCHA 18/03/2025 a; The Guardian 18/03/2025). With the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) specifically targeting hospitals and healthcare workers since October 2023, causing Gaza\\u2019s health system to collapse completely, leaving it without any capacity even before the ceasefire (Insecurity Insight 06/11/2024).\\n\\nUntil 25 March 2025, no safe zones had been established.

As the occupying Power, Israel is always obliged to ensure sufficient food, medical supplies and other relief services. By deliberately cutting vital supplies, including those relating to sexual and reproductive health, and assistive devices for persons with disabilities, Israel is once again weaponising aid. These are serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights laws, and war crimes and crimes against humanity under the Rome Statute.\\n\\nThe so-called three phase ceasefire deal should have led to a permanent cessation of hostilities and the release of all Palestinians and Israelis unlawfully detained as a most basic requisite for sustainable peace.

The deal would consist of three phases, each lasting 6 weeks. In the first phase, Hamas released 25 hostages and the bodies of 8 more, while Israel released hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Israel also allowed humanitarian aid to enter Gaza, 25,000 trucks according to Israel's Minister of Foreign Affairs. The original plan was that, in the second phase, Hamas would release all remaining alive male Israelis and Israel would release an agreed upon number of Palestinian prisoners, while the parties would also agree to a withdrawal of remaining Israeli soldiers from the Gaza Strip and a more permanent cessation of hostilities. Then, in the third phase, both Israel and Hamas would release all the remaining bodies of dead captives, Israel would end the blockade of the Gaza Strip, and Hamas would not rebuild its military capabilities. However, after the end of the first phase, on March 2, 2025, Israel halted all humanitarian aid and goods from entering Gaza, with the goal of pressuring Hamas into accepting a new agreement, backed by the United States. This would extend the first phase for seven more weeks and would involve Hamas releasing half of the remaining hostages. After the blockade, prices for essentials like sugar, oil, and chicken rose significantly. The UN called the blockade alarming and condemned it along with UK, France, and Germany, citing violations of humanitarian law that mandates aid access.

      "content": "Based on the gathered evidence, here is the current situation regarding the blockade of humanitarian aid into Gaza:\n\n1. **Current Blockade Status**: Since March 2, 2025, Israel has blocked all humanitarian aid, including fuel, from entering Gaza. This action is in violation of international humanitarian law, as reported by multiple sources including Human Rights Watch and ReliefWeb.\n\n2. **Humanitarian Impact**: The blockade has caused significant distress in Gaza, with reports of food supplies running out and medical facilities being overwhelmed. The World Food Programme warned that food supplies for public kitchens and bakeries would run out in less than two weeks if aid is not allowed in.\n\n3. **Ceasefire Collapse**: On March 17, 2025, Israel unilaterally ended the ceasefire with Hamas and resumed air strikes on Gaza. This has further complicated the situation and hindered any progress towards resuming aid.\n\n4. **International Response**: The blockade and resumption of hostilities have been condemned by the UN, several countries, and international human rights organizations. There is significant international pressure on Israel to lift the blockade and allow humanitarian aid to resume.\n\n5. **Diplomatic Efforts**: Despite international condemnation and legal orders from bodies like the International Court of Justice, there has been no indication of a breakthrough in negotiations or a change in Israel's stance regarding the blockade.\n\nGiven the current situation, the probability of Israel lifting the blockade and allowing humanitarian aid into Gaza before April 7, 2025, seems low. The ongoing military operations, the collapse of the ceasefire, and the lack of progress in diplomatic negotiations suggest that the blockade is likely to continue in the short term.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1"
