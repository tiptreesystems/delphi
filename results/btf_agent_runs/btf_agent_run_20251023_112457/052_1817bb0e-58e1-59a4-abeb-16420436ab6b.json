  "question": "Will Tesla's total vehicle deliveries for Q1 2025 be greater than 450,000 vehicles?",
  "probability": 0.1,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here are the key points affecting Tesla's vehicle deliveries for Q1 2025:\n\n1. **Morgan Stanley Forecast**: Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas estimates Tesla's Q1 2025 deliveries to be 351,000 vehicles, significantly below the 450,000 threshold needed for a \"YES\" resolution. This estimate is a reduction of 64,000 units from previous forecasts due to declining sales in major markets like Europe, China, and the US.\n\n2. **Political and Social Impact**: Elon Musk's political involvement with President Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency has led to increased protests and boycotts against Tesla. These actions have negatively affected Tesla's brand image and consumer sentiment, particularly among liberal buyers. While Tesla has gained some traction among conservative buyers, it is unclear if this will compensate for the loss in other demographics.\n\n3. **Protests and Vandalism**: There have been numerous protests and incidents of vandalism against Tesla, which could disrupt operations and deter potential buyers. These activities are likely contributing to the decline in sales and deliveries.\n\n4. **Market Competition**: Tesla is facing increased competition from other automakers like General Motors, Ford, Honda, and Hyundai, which are ramping up their EV production. This competition is affecting Tesla's market share and sales.\n\n5. **Stock Performance**: Tesla's stock has lost about 40% of its value since the start of the year, indicating potential financial instability and a lack of investor confidence.\n\nGiven these factors, it seems unlikely that Tesla will achieve vehicle deliveries greater than 450,000 for Q1 2025. The forecasted deliveries are significantly below this threshold, and the negative impacts from political involvement, protests, and increased competition further reduce the likelihood of surpassing 450,000 deliveries.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1",

Tesla shares closed at $236 on Thursday suggesting that the price target — despite reduced — still represents an upside potential of 73.7%.\n\nTesla shares have dropped 41.50% year-to-date.\n\n“We reiterate our view that while Tesla’s YTD auto deliveries have been mostly below expectations, it is not particularly narrative changing for our investment thesis,” the analyst wrote before detailing the reduction of delivery estimates.\n\n“With this report, we lower Tesla’s auto deliveries for both the first quarter and the full year driven by competition, an aging lineup and a buyers’ strike from negative brand sentiment and upcoming new product\n\nMorgan Stanley reduced its forecast of annual deliveries to 1.615 million which would represent a year on year decline of 9.8% when compared to 2024. Previously, Adam Jonas was forecasting the carmaker to post a 7.5% growth with 1.924 million EVs delivered.\n\nIn the long run, for 2030, the firm cut its estimates to 4.7 million units, down from 5.2 million previously.\n\n“Our conversations with investors and recent survey showed that investors are beginning to contemplate lower y/y volume (with 21% expecting deliveries down by more than 10% y/y), a marked shift from our Tesla Bull Bear Lunch in January where sentiment on full year growth was far more bullish,” the analyst wrote.\n\nMorgan Stanley said “slower delivery ramp” caused a reduction on its “Core Auto contribution to our lowered price target (now less than 20% of our $410 PT) and flows through to lower Network Services valuation ($161 of our $410 PT) due to a lower Tesla car park on which to a…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 372 words out of ~731.

An opinion piece on the current anti-Tesla environment.\nsitename: Not a Tesla App\ndate: 2025-03-22\ncategories: ['News']\ntags: ['Tesla, Protests, Vandalism, Boycott, Elon Musk,']\n---\n[The Backlash Against Tesla: Who’s Really Paying the Price?](https://www.notateslaapp.com/news/2591/the-backlash-against-tesla-whos-really-paying-the-price)\n\nElon Musk has always been a bit of a celebrity and not always one that has been well received. With his many different companies - including Tesla, SpaceX, Boring, Neuralink, X, and xAI, he’s spread throughout many high-tech fields and has a massive say in the way technology impacts the lives of many.\n\nMost recently, Elon has taken to the fore of the US government under the Trump Administration and is running the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Here, he’s been tasked with reducing government spending.\n\nThese moves, in addition to what looked like an inappropriate hand gesture at a Republican rally last year, have led to him being labeled a Nazi - and those who own his cars or support his companies - as Nazi sympathizers. This is particularly true for Cybertruck owners.\n\nWe’re not calling for Elon to step down or stop - that’s beyond the scope of this opinion piece. Instead, we’re hoping that we make a point - harming real people and their property is a step too far, especially when they haven’t done anything other than spend their money or choose their place of employment.\n\n## Boycotts and Protests\n\nFew CEOs are as active in politics as Elon is - and that’s made him and his companies the targets of protestors who don't agree with the changes and policies. This has led to boycotts of Tesla, protests outside factories, Supercharger sites, and showrooms.\n\nInterestingly, some protestors at several locations throughout the United States have admitted they are being paid to protest. This isn’t surprising or new - political activist organizations sometimes bring in paid protestors to pad crowd numbers or guide the protestors toward their goals. While we can’t say whether this is true or not at this time, Elon appears to believe so, as per [a post](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1898369343399899218…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 373 words out of ~1393.

With his many different companies - including Tesla, SpaceX, Boring, Neuralink, X, and xAI, he\\u2019s spread throughout many high-tech fields and has a massive say in the way technology impacts the lives of many.\\n\\nMost recently, Elon has taken to the fore of the US government under the Trump Administration and is running the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Here, he\\u2019s been tasked with reducing government spending.\\n\\nThese moves, in addition to what looked like an inappropriate hand gesture at a Republican rally last year, have led to him being labeled a Nazi - and those who own his cars or support his companies - as Nazi sympathizers. This is particularly true for Cybertruck owners.\\n\\nWe\\u2019re not calling for Elon to step down or stop - that\\u2019s beyond the scope of this opinion piece. Instead, we\\u2019re hoping that we make a point - harming real people and their property is a step too far, especially when they haven\\u2019t done anything other than spend their money or choose their place of employment.\\n\\n## Boycotts and Protests\\n\\nFew CEOs are as active in politics as Elon is - and that\\u2019s made him and his companies the targets of protestors who don't agree with the changes and policies. This has led to boycotts of Tesla, protests outside factories, Supercharger sites, and showrooms.\\n\\nInterestingly, some protestors at several locations throughout the United States have admitted they are being paid to protest. This isn\\u2019t surprising or new - political activist organizations sometimes bring in paid protestors to pad crowd numbers or guide the protestors toward their goals. While we can\\u2019t say whether this is true or not at this time, Elon appears to believe so, as per [a post](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1898369343399899218\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 373 words out of ~1393.

      "content": "Based on the gathered evidence, here are the key points affecting Tesla's vehicle deliveries for Q1 2025:\n\n1. **Morgan Stanley Forecast**: Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas estimates Tesla's Q1 2025 deliveries to be 351,000 vehicles, significantly below the 450,000 threshold needed for a \"YES\" resolution. This estimate is a reduction of 64,000 units from previous forecasts due to declining sales in major markets like Europe, China, and the US.\n\n2. **Political and Social Impact**: Elon Musk's political involvement with President Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency has led to increased protests and boycotts against Tesla. These actions have negatively affected Tesla's brand image and consumer sentiment, particularly among liberal buyers. While Tesla has gained some traction among conservative buyers, it is unclear if this will compensate for the loss in other demographics.\n\n3. **Protests and Vandalism**: There have been numerous protests and incidents of vandalism against Tesla, which could disrupt operations and deter potential buyers. These activities are likely contributing to the decline in sales and deliveries.\n\n4. **Market Competition**: Tesla is facing increased competition from other automakers like General Motors, Ford, Honda, and Hyundai, which are ramping up their EV production. This competition is affecting Tesla's market share and sales.\n\n5. **Stock Performance**: Tesla's stock has lost about 40% of its value since the start of the year, indicating potential financial instability and a lack of investor confidence.\n\nGiven these factors, it seems unlikely that Tesla will achieve vehicle deliveries greater than 450,000 for Q1 2025. The forecasted deliveries are significantly below this threshold, and the negative impacts from political involvement, protests, and increased competition further reduce the likelihood of surpassing 450,000 deliveries.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1"
