  "question": "Will Alphabet be the world's most valuable company by market cap on March 29, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.1,
  "reasoning": "Based on the information gathered, here are the key points relevant to the question of whether Alphabet will be the world's most valuable company by market cap on March 29, 2025:\n\n1. **Current Market Cap Rankings (as of March 3, 2025):**\n   - Apple has the highest market cap at $3.63 trillion.\n   - Nvidia follows with a market cap of $3.05 trillion.\n   - Microsoft is third with a market cap of $2.95 trillion.\n   - Amazon is fourth.\n   - Alphabet is fifth with a market cap of $2.10 trillion.\n\n2. **Economic and Market Conditions:**\n   - The global economic outlook for 2025 is weak, with a projected real GDP growth of 2.5%.\n   - The US economy is facing headwinds such as federal layoffs and higher import tariffs, which could impact US-based companies like Alphabet.\n   - Growth stocks, which include many tech companies like Alphabet, were trading at a premium, indicating potential overvaluation.\n   - Alphabet is facing antitrust lawsuits, which could negatively impact its valuation.\n\n3. **Sector Performance:**\n   - The communication-services sector, which includes Alphabet, has become more undervalued following increases in fair values for stocks like Alphabet and Meta.\n   - There is a shift in investor preference towards value stocks over growth stocks.\n\nGiven these factors, Alphabet is currently ranked fifth in terms of market capitalization and faces significant challenges, including economic headwinds and legal issues. The likelihood of Alphabet surpassing Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Amazon to become the most valuable company by market cap by March 29, 2025, seems low.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1",

Growing uncertainty about the impact of the US administration’s policy agenda weighed on both corporate and consumer sentiment, and concerns about growth started to re-emerge. Weak US performance dragged on developed market equities, which delivered a -0.7% total return over the month.\n\nA silver lining for multi-asset investors was global bonds, which once again proved to be diversifiers against equity losses. Despite the potential for tariffs to reignite inflation and firmer than expected inflation data, global bond markets focused on weaker US sentiment data and the risks to growth. February saw both business and consumer sentiment weaken. Services activity and small business investment intentions both fell, while consumer confidence registered its largest decline since August 2021. The House of Representatives did agree a budget blueprint but while this provided enough fiscal room to extend the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, it didn’t clearly point to additional new fiscal stimulus. Against this backdrop, Treasury yields fell over the month and the Bloomberg Global Aggregate index returned 1.4% over February.\n\nContinued positive momentum in Chinese tech stocks helped emerging markets outperform their developed market peers, returning 0.5% over the month. Emerging markets received a further tailwind from a weakening US dollar. The broad dollar DXY Index fell by 0.7% over the month and boosted the returns of dollar denominated global indices. Real estate investment trusts were another beneficiary of falling yields. Solid performance from US and dollar denominated European real estate helped the global benchmark rise 2.6% to end the month as the top performing major asset class.\n\nDespite normally being supported by falling yields, global small cap stocks underperformed, deliveri…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 352 words out of ~926.

Divining between news that identifies a paradigm shift that will either positively or negatively affect earnings (signal) versus news that garners a lot of attention yet will not meaningfully impact a company’s business (noise).\n\nOnly two months into the year and it already feels like we have had a full year’s worth of headlines. From earnings and guidance, to the DeepSeek scare, to President Donald Trump’s on-again, off-again tariffs, volatility has risen anew.\n\nIn such an environment, what’s an investor to do? Investors should focus on the fundamentals, maintain a long-term mindset, and pay attention to valuations. And that is just what our analyst team is doing, scrutinizing the long-term fundamentals underlying sector outlooks and analyzing the long-term assumptions that drive our valuation models. Considering how fluid the situation remains as to the threats of implementing tariffs, once we have specificity on the amount of tariffs that will be implemented and a base case as to how long those tariffs may last, we will adjust our projections and valuations accordingly.\n\n## US Stock Market Valuation and Outlook\n\nAs of Feb. 28, 2025, according to a composite of our valuations, the US stock market was trading at about a 1% discount to fair value. That was the first time since a year ago (when stocks pulled back following inflation data that led to a shift in interest-rate expectations) the market has traded at a discount to a composite of our fair values.\n\n## Value Is Significantly Outperforming…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 375 words out of ~1399.

Our global real GDP growth projection for 2025 has been cut to 2.5% in our March forecast round. This would be the weakest outcome since 2009, outside of the COVID-19 shock. A marginal pick-up in global growth is forecast in 2026, to 2.7%, reﬂecting a boost from additional ﬁscal stimulus in Europe. The risks to both years’ forecasts increasingly look to be on the downside absent a major shift in the US administration’s policy approach.\n\n**The largest reductions to our growth forecasts in 2025–26 are in the Americas. **Several recent US indicators have pointed to considerably weaker growth in the ﬁrst quarter of 2025 than we had previously forecast. More federal layoffs and higher import tariffs than previously assumed are additional near-term headwinds to growth. Consistent with an upward revision to our US consumer price inﬂation forecast for 2025, the US Federal Reserve is now expected to leave policy rates unchanged through most of 2025.

Morgan Asset Management\ndate: 2025-03-03\ntags: ['Equities,Insights,Investment Trust Insights,Markets,Market Insights,Education']\n---\nIn a silver lining for multi-asset investors, global bonds once again proved to be diversifiers against equity losses.\n\nAfter a strong start to 2025, February saw some of the shine come off the US exceptionalism story. Growing uncertainty about the impact of the US administration’s policy agenda weighed on both corporate and consumer sentiment, and concerns about growth started to re-emerge. Weak US performance dragged on developed market equities, which delivered a -0.7% total return over the month.\n\nA silver lining for multi-asset investors was global bonds, which once again proved to be diversifiers against equity losses. Despite the potential for tariffs to reignite inflation and firmer than expected inflation data, global bond markets focused on weaker US sentiment data and the risks to growth. February saw both business and consumer sentiment weaken. Services activity and small business investment intentions both fell, while consumer confidence registered its largest decline since August 2021. The House of Representatives did agree a budget blueprint but while this provided enough fiscal room to extend the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, it didn’t clearly point to additional new fiscal stimulus. Against this backdrop, Treasury yields fell over the month and the Bloomberg Global Aggregate index returned 1.4% over February.\n\nContinued positive momentum in Chinese tech stocks helped emerging markets outperform their developed market peers, returning 0.5% over the month.

Growing uncertainty about the impact of the US administration\\u2019s policy agenda weighed on both corporate and consumer sentiment, and concerns about growth started to re-emerge. Weak US performance dragged on developed market equities, which delivered a -0.7% total return over the month.\\n\\nA silver lining for multi-asset investors was global bonds, which once again proved to be diversifiers against equity losses. Despite the potential for tariffs to reignite inflation and firmer than expected inflation data, global bond markets focused on weaker US sentiment data and the risks to growth. February saw both business and consumer sentiment weaken. Services activity and small business investment intentions both fell, while consumer confidence registered its largest decline since August 2021. The House of Representatives did agree a budget blueprint but while this provided enough fiscal room to extend the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, it didn\\u2019t clearly point to additional new fiscal stimulus. Against this backdrop, Treasury yields fell over the month and the Bloomberg Global Aggregate index returned 1.4% over February.\\n\\nContinued positive momentum in Chinese tech stocks helped emerging markets outperform their developed market peers, returning 0.5% over the month.

February saw both business and consumer sentiment weaken.

The House of Representatives did agree a budget blueprint but while this provided enough fiscal room to extend the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, it didn\\u2019t clearly point to additional new fiscal stimulus. Against this backdrop, Treasury yields fell over the month and the Bloomberg Global Aggregate index returned 1.4% over February.\\n\\nContinued positive momentum in Chinese tech stocks helped emerging markets outperform their developed market peers, returning 0.5% over the month. Emerging markets received a further tailwind from a weakening US dollar. The broad dollar DXY Index fell by 0.7% over the month and boosted the returns of dollar denominated global indices. Real estate investment trusts were another beneficiary of falling yields.

Divining between news that identifies a paradigm shift that will either positively or negatively affect earnings (signal) versus news that garners a lot of attention yet will not meaningfully impact a company\\u2019s business (noise).\\n\\nOnly two months into the year and it already feels like we have had a full year\\u2019s worth of headlines. From earnings and guidance, to the DeepSeek scare, to President Donald Trump\\u2019s on-again, off-again tariffs, volatility has risen anew.\\n\\nIn such an environment, what\\u2019s an investor to do? Investors should focus on the fundamentals, maintain a long-term mindset, and pay attention to valuations. And that is just what our analyst team is doing, scrutinizing the long-term fundamentals underlying sector outlooks and analyzing the long-term assumptions that drive our valuation models. Considering how fluid the situation remains as to the threats of implementing tariffs, once we have specificity on the amount of tariffs that will be implemented and a base case as to how long those tariffs may last, we will adjust our projections and valuations accordingly.\\n\\n## US Stock Market Valuation and Outlook\\n\\nAs of Feb. 28, 2025, according to a composite of our valuations, the US stock market was trading at about a 1% discount to fair value. That was the first time since a year ago (when stocks pulled back following inflation data that led to a shift in interest-rate expectations) the market has traded at a discount to a composite of our fair values.\\n\\n## Value Is Significantly Outperforming\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 375 words out of ~1399.

The likelihood of Alphabet surpassing Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Amazon to become the most valuable company by market cap by March 29, 2025, seems low.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1"
