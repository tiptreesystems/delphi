  "reasoning": "Based on the information gathered:\n\n1. **Nomination**: \"Before I Change My Mind\" is nominated for the Outstanding Film – Limited Theatrical Release at the 36th Annual GLAAD Media Awards.\n\n2. **Selection Criteria**: The GLAAD Media Awards evaluate nominees based on fair, accurate, and inclusive representations of the LGBTQ community, boldness and originality, significant cultural impact on mainstream culture, and overall quality of the project.\n\n3. **Award Ceremony**: The awards will be held on March 27, 2025, in Los Angeles, California.\n\n4. **Selection Process**: The selection involves over 700 GLAAD Media Award voters and volunteers, with results certified by a Review Panel.\n\nGiven that \"Before I Change My Mind\" is nominated and considering the selection criteria, the probability of it winning depends on how well it meets these criteria compared to other nominees. Without specific expert predictions or additional context on its reception relative to other nominees, it's challenging to provide a precise probability. However, being nominated is a positive indicator.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.25",
