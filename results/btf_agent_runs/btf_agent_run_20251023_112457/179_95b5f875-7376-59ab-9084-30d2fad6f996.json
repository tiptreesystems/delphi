  "question": "Will the DC cherry trees reach peak bloom on March 29 in 2025?",
  "probability": 0.25,
  "reasoning": "Based on the information gathered:\n\n1. The National Park Service (NPS) has forecasted the peak bloom for 2025 to occur between March 28 and 31.\n2. The peak bloom date is defined as when 70% of the Yoshino Cherry blossoms are open.\n3. The most likely time for peak bloom is between the last week of March and the first week of April.\n4. Historical data shows variability in peak bloom dates, with extremes as early as March 15 and as late as April 18.\n\nGiven that the forecasted window for peak bloom includes March 29, there is a reasonable probability that the peak bloom could occur on that date. However, the forecast is a range, and the actual date could be any day within that period.\n\nConsidering these factors, I estimate the probability that the DC cherry trees will reach peak bloom on March 29 in 2025 as follows:\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.25",

Peak bloom varies annually depending on weather conditions. The most likely time to reach peak bloom is between the last week of March and the first week of April. Extraordinary warm or cool temperatures have resulted in peak bloom as early as March 15 (1990) and as late as April 18 (1958).\n\n\n**How long is peak bloom? **\n\nThe Yoshino trees typically bloom for a period of **several days**. The length of the blooming period depends on weather conditions. Cool, calm weather can extend the length of the bloom, and a rainy, windy day can bring an abrupt end to the ephemeral blossoms. A late frost can prevent the trees from blooming at all.\n\n\n**Predicting the bloom.**\n\nForecasting peak bloom is almost impossible more than **10 days in advance**. The cherry trees' blossom development is dependent on weather conditions. National Park Service horticulturists monitor bud development and report the status of the blossoms.\n\nYear |\nGreen Buds |\nFlorets Visible |\nExtension of Florets |\nPeduncle Elongation |\nPuffy White |\nPeak Bloom |\n| 2025 | Mar 11 |\nMar 16 |\nMar 19 |\nMar 20 |\n||\n| 2024 | Mar 2 | Mar 5 | Mar 8 | Mar 12 | Mar 15 | Mar 17 |\n| 2023 | Feb 23 | Mar 1 | Mar 7 | Mar 11 | Mar 18 | Mar 23 |\n| 2022 | Mar 3 | Mar 7 | Mar 14 | Mar 17 | Mar 19 | Mar 21 |\n| 2021 | Mar 11 | Mar 16 | Mar 22 | Mar 24 | Mar 26 | Mar 28 |\n| 2020 | Feb 28 | Mar 3 | Mar 9 | Mar 12 | Mar 16 | Mar 20 |\n| 2019 | Mar 5 | Mar 17 | Mar 23 | Mar 25 | Mar 29 | Apr 1 |\n| 2018 | Feb 25 | Mar 15 | Mar 26 | Mar 29 | Apr 1 | Apr 5 |\n| 2017 | Feb 24 | Mar 1 | Mar 6 | Mar 8 | Mar 22* | Mar 25* |\n| 2016 | Mar 8 | Mar 13 | Mar 15 | Mar 17 | Mar 22 | Mar 25 |\n| 2015 | Mar 18 | Apr 1 | Apr 4 | Apr 6 | Apr 8 | Apr 10 |\n| 2014 | Mar 16 | Ma…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 482 words out of ~848.

Peak bloom varies annually depending on weather conditions. The most likely time to reach peak bloom is between the last week of March and the first week of April.

The length of the blooming period depends on weather conditions. Cool, calm weather can extend the length of the bloom, and a rainy, windy day can bring an abrupt end to the ephemeral blossoms. A late frost can prevent the trees from blooming at all.\n\n\n**Predicting the bloom.**\n\nForecasting peak bloom is almost impossible more than **10 days in advance**. The cherry trees' blossom development is dependent on weather conditions.

The trees were largely planted around the Tidal Basin near the Jefferson Memorial. Over time, some of the original trees have died, but have been replaced or propagated, to reach a total of about 3,800 trees as of 2025. Every year since 1927, the National Cherry Blossom Festival commemorates this gift with a celebration that has grown from a simple ceremony into a major cultural event drawing visitors from around the world to watch the cherries bloom, signalling the arrival of spring. The timing of the bloom varies each year, depending on weather conditions, and is carefully tracked by the National Park Service (NPS). Peak bloom is defined as the day when 70% of the Yoshino cherry blossoms are open - the Yoshino variety being the most common in the Tidal Basin. It usually happens in the last week of March or the first week of April, but extreme temperatures have resulted in peaks as early as March 15 (1990) and as late as April 18 (1958). As of the beginning of March, peak bloom is forecasted to take place between March 28 and 31. Data for past blooms can be found here.\",\"resolution_criteria\":\"This question will resolve as YES if the National Park Service (NPS) announces that the 2025 Peak Bloom date occurred on March 29. Otherwise, it will resolve as NO.\",\"present_date\":\"2025-03-25T05:53:33.004214\"}"
