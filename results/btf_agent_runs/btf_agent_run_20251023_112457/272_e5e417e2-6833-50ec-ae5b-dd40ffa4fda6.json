  "question": "Will the number of active US drilling rigs be 580 to 584 on March 28, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.1,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered information, here is the analysis:\n\n1. **Current Rig Count**: As of March 14, 2025, the U.S. rig count was reported at 592, with oil rigs at 487 and gas rigs at 100. This is above the target range of 580 to 584 rigs.\n\n2. **Oil Prices**: The price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil has been declining, with the latest price at $67.19 per barrel as of March 19, 2025. This is below the $89/barrel price point identified as necessary for substantial increases in drilling activity. Lower oil prices can discourage new drilling and may lead to a reduction in active rigs.\n\n3. **Policy and Market Forces**: Despite President Trump's executive orders to increase oil and gas production, market forces such as low energy prices and a shift towards renewable energy are influencing the sector. There are also legal challenges to some of the government's directives, which could impact the implementation of these policies.\n\n4. **Historical Context**: The rig count has fluctuated around the target range in the past, but recent counts have been consistently above it. The current trend does not suggest a decrease to the target range within the next week.\n\nGiven the current rig count, the declining oil prices, and the influence of market forces and policy challenges, it seems unlikely that the rig count will fall to the range of 580 to 584 by March 28, 2025.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1",

The move was followed by a [directive that aimed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/) to roll back regulations on the oil and gas sector, and accelerate drilling and pipeline development.\n\n“We will drill, baby, drill,” Trump said in his [inauguration speech](https://www.whitehouse.gov/remarks/2025/01/the-inaugural-address/), adding that the US has the “largest amount of oil and gas of any country on Earth — and we are going to use it.”\n\nYet some industry observers have speculated that [energy prices](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/business/energy-environment/oil-trump-drill-baby-drill.html) and [other market forces](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/oil-industry-unlikely-rush-alaska-despite-trumps-call-drill-2025-01-23/) may deter energy companies from increasing drilling, noting that the US has been the world's top [crude oil](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61545) and [liquefied natural gas](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61683) producer for several years now.

Additionally, Doug Bergum, Trump's nominee for Secretary of the Interior, [has promised](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/dec/01/doug-burgum-trump-interior-secretary-drilling) to open up federally-protected lands to expedited oil and gas drilling permits.\n\nHowever, OilPrice.com [reports](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Exxon-Pours-Cold-Water-On-Trumps-Drill-Baby-Drill-Plans.html) that it might not be this simple, quoting Exxon’s Upstream President Liam Mallon  and TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanne as saying it is more likely that oil producers, due to a looming surplus of oil in 2025 combined with a need to maximize shareholder returns on capital, may throttle new production in order to avoid price destruction.\n\nAccording to the Financial Times ([‘Drill, baby, drill’ is not so simple](https://www.ft.com/content/90468253-0560-4cb2-a302-2e8636234265)), a key factor will be oil prices. A Kansas City Fed survey of energy firms found that a price of \\$89/barrel was needed for drilling to substantially increase, while oil prices as of January 2025 have been on a downswing:\n\n![Price history](https://metaculus-web-media.s3.amazonaws.com/user_uploaded/Screenshot_2024-12-05_at_2.40.51%C3%A2PM.png)\n\nAccording to Baker Hughes in its recent [annual report](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1701605/000170160524000033/bkr-20231231.htm):\n\n> The Baker Hughes rig counts are an important business barometer for the drilling industry and its suppliers. When drilling rigs are active they consume products and services produced by the oil service industry. Rig count trends are driven by the exploration and development spending by oil and natural gas companies, which in turn is influenced by current and future price expectations for oil and natural gas. The counts may reflect the relative strength and stability of energy prices and overall market activity; however, these counts should not be solely relied on as other specific and pervasive conditions may exist that affect overall energy prices and market activity.\n\n> We have been providing rig counts to the public since 1944. We gather all relevant data through our field service personnel, who obtain the necessary data from routine visits to the various rigs, customers, contractors and other outside sources as necessary. We base the classification of a well as either oil or natural gas primarily upon filings made by operators in the relevant jurisdiction. This data is then compiled and distributed to various wire services and trade associations and is published on our website. We believe the counting process and resulting data is reliable; however, it is subject to our ability to obtain accurate and timely information. Rig counts are compiled weekly for the U.S. and Canada and monthly for all international rigs. Published international rig counts do not include rigs drilling in certain locations, such as onshore China because this information is not readily available.\n\n> Rigs in the U.S. and Canada are counted as active if, on the day the count is taken, the well being drilled has been started but drilling has not been completed and the well is anticipated to be of sufficient depth to be a potential consumer of our drill bits. In international areas, rigs are counted on a weekly basis and deemed active if drilling activities occurred during the majority of the week. The weekly results are then averaged for the month and published accordingly. The rig count does not include rigs that are in transit from one location to another, rigging up, being used in non-drilling activities including production testing, completion and workover, and are not expected to be significant consumers of drill bits.\n\nAccording to the rig count [FAQ](https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/rig-count-faqs), data is published each Friday at noon central US time.

Image: Unsplash\\n\\n**The United States has vowed to increase oil and gas production.****A shift to renewables and other market forces, however, are also influencing the sector.****We ask Jeff Gustavson, President of Chevron New Energies, about how the industry is reacting.**\\n\\nIn January, on his first day back in the White House, US President Donald Trump signed an [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/declaring-a-national-energy-emergency/) declaring a national energy emergency. The move was followed by a [directive that aimed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/) to roll back regulations on the oil and gas sector, and accelerate drilling and pipeline development.\\n\\n\\u201cWe will drill, baby, drill,\\u201d Trump said in his [inauguration speech](https://www.whitehouse.gov/remarks/2025/01/the-inaugural-address/), adding that the US has the \\u201clargest amount of oil and gas of any country on Earth \\u2014 and we are going to use it.\\u201d\\n\\nYet some industry observers have speculated that [energy prices](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/business/energy-environment/oil-trump-drill-baby-drill.html) and [other market forces](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/oil-industry-unlikely-rush-alaska-despite-trumps-call-drill-2025-01-23/) may deter energy companies from increasing drilling, noting that the US has been the world's top [crude oil](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61545) and [liquefied natural gas](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61683) producer for several years now.

      "content": "Based on the gathered information, here is the analysis:\n\n1. **Current Rig Count**: As of March 14, 2025, the U.S. rig count was reported at 592, with oil rigs at 487 and gas rigs at 100. This is above the target range of 580 to 584 rigs.\n\n2. **Oil Prices**: The price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil has been declining, with the latest price at $67.19 per barrel as of March 19, 2025. This is below the $89/barrel price point identified as necessary for substantial increases in drilling activity. Lower oil prices can discourage new drilling and may lead to a reduction in active rigs.\n\n3. **Policy and Market Forces**: Despite President Trump's executive orders to increase oil and gas production, market forces such as low energy prices and a shift towards renewable energy are influencing the sector. There are also legal challenges to some of the government's directives, which could impact the implementation of these policies.\n\n4. **Historical Context**: The rig count has fluctuated around the target range in the past, but recent counts have been consistently above it. The current trend does not suggest a decrease to the target range within the next week.\n\nGiven the current rig count, the declining oil prices, and the influence of market forces and policy challenges, it seems unlikely that the rig count will fall to the range of 580 to 584 by March 28, 2025.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1"
