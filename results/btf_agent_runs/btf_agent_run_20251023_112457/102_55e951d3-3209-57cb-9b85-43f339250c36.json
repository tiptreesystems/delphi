  "question": "Will there be fewer than 10 people in space on March 29, 2025, according to whoisinspace.com?",
  "probability": 0.1,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here is the current situation regarding the number of people in space around March 29, 2025:\n\n1. **Current and Planned Crew Movements:**\n   - As of January 14, 2025, there were 10 humans in space.\n   - SpaceX Crew-9 landed on March 18, 2025, which would have reduced the number of people in space.\n   - SpaceX Crew-10 launched on March 14, 2025, with four astronauts, replacing Crew-9, maintaining the number of people in space.\n   - There are no planned launches or landings that would change the number of people in space before March 29, 2025.\n\n2. **Upcoming Missions:**\n   - A Blue Origin New Shepard rocket is scheduled to launch with an all-female crew of six passengers on March 30, 2025, which is after the target date.\n   - A SpaceX Dragon spacecraft is planned to launch on a crewed mission into polar orbit on March 31, 2025, which is also after the target date.\n   - Soyuz MS-27 is scheduled to launch on April 8, 2025.\n\nGiven the information, the number of people in space is likely to remain at 10 until at least March 29, 2025, as there are no scheduled events that would reduce the number below 10 before that date.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1",
