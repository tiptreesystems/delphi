  "question": "Will the temperature in San Francisco, CA ever go below 40 degrees F in the entire month of February 2025?",
  "probability": 0.05,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence:\n\n1. The historical weather data for February 2025 from Weather Spark does not explicitly mention any temperatures below 40 degrees Fahrenheit. However, it provides a general overview of weather conditions such as precipitation and wind speeds.\n\n2. The detailed weather forecast from World Weather for February 2025 indicates that the lowest forecasted temperatures are 43°F on February 10th and 11th. No forecasted low temperatures are below 40°F for the entire month.\n\nGiven this information, it appears unlikely that the temperature in San Francisco, CA, will go below 40 degrees Fahrenheit in February 2025. The historical data and forecasts both suggest that temperatures are staying above this threshold.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.05",

However, it provides a general overview of weather conditions such as precipitation and wind speeds.\n\n2. The detailed weather forecast from World Weather for February 2025 indicates that the lowest forecasted temperatures are 43°F on February 10th and 11th. No forecasted low temperatures are below 40°F for the entire month.\n\nGiven this information, it appears unlikely that the temperature in San Francisco, CA, will go below 40 degrees Fahrenheit in February 2025. The historical data and forecasts both suggest that temperatures are staying above this threshold.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.05"
