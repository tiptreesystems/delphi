  "question": "Will Bluesky have more than 1,400,000 unique posters on March 30, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.85,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here are the key points relevant to estimating the probability that Bluesky will have more than 1,400,000 unique posters on March 30, 2025:\n\n1. **User Growth**: Bluesky's user base has grown significantly, reaching over 33 million users by March 2025. This is a rapid increase from 13 million users in late October 2024, indicating strong growth momentum.\n\n2. **Daily Active Users and Posters**: As of November 2024, Bluesky had around 3.2 million daily active users in the US and approximately 1.3 million daily unique posters. Given the continued growth in users, it's reasonable to expect that the number of unique posters has also increased.\n\n3. **Engagement and Features**: Bluesky has been actively adding new features and updates to enhance user engagement, such as reply controls, profile search, and trending topics. These efforts are likely to maintain or increase the number of active posters.\n\n4. **Migration from Other Platforms**: The growth of Bluesky is partly fueled by users migrating from other platforms like X (formerly Twitter), suggesting a trend that could continue to drive user and poster growth.\n\nGiven these points, it seems highly probable that Bluesky will have more than 1,400,000 unique posters by March 30, 2025.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.85",

      "content": "Based on the gathered evidence, here are the key points relevant to estimating the probability that Bluesky will have more than 1,400,000 unique posters on March 30, 2025:\n\n1. **User Growth**: Bluesky's user base has grown significantly, reaching over 33 million users by March 2025. This is a rapid increase from 13 million users in late October 2024, indicating strong growth momentum.\n\n2. **Daily Active Users and Posters**: As of November 2024, Bluesky had around 3.2 million daily active users in the US and approximately 1.3 million daily unique posters. Given the continued growth in users, it's reasonable to expect that the number of unique posters has also increased.\n\n3. **Engagement and Features**: Bluesky has been actively adding new features and updates to enhance user engagement, such as reply controls, profile search, and trending topics. These efforts are likely to maintain or increase the number of active posters.\n\n4. **Migration from Other Platforms**: The growth of Bluesky is partly fueled by users migrating from other platforms like X (formerly Twitter), suggesting a trend that could continue to drive user and poster growth.\n\nGiven these points, it seems highly probable that Bluesky will have more than 1,400,000 unique posters by March 30, 2025.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.85"
