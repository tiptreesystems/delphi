  "question": "Will \"Crossing\" win the 2025 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Film -- Limited Release?",
  "probability": 0.1,
  "reasoning": "Based on the information gathered, \"Crossing\" is indeed nominated for the Outstanding Film – Limited Release category at the 36th GLAAD Media Awards. The competition in this category includes films such as \"20,000 Species of Bees,\" \"Backspot,\" \"Before I Change My Mind,\" \"Big Boys,\" \"Close to You,\" \"Fitting In,\" \"High Tide,\" \"Housekeeping for Beginners,\" and \"A Place of Our Own.\"\n\nThe GLAAD Media Awards evaluate nominees based on fair, accurate, and inclusive representations of the LGBTQ community, boldness and originality, cultural impact, and overall quality. The selection process involves over 700 voters and volunteers, with results certified by a review panel.\n\nGiven that \"Crossing\" has been nominated, it is recognized for meeting the criteria to a significant extent. However, without specific insights into the critical reception and cultural impact of \"Crossing\" compared to its competitors, it's challenging to determine its likelihood of winning precisely.\n\nConsidering the competitive nature of the category and the fact that \"Crossing\" is one of several nominees, I estimate the probability of \"Crossing\" winning the award to be moderate.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1",

'Emilia Pérez' gets snubbed.\nsitename: Deadline\ndate: 2025-01-22\ncategories: ['News']\n---\nWe have the nominees for the 36th annual [GLAAD](https://deadline.com/tag/glaad/) Media Awards, which honor fair, accurate and inclusive representations of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community in film, TV, music, videogames, podcasts, journalism and more.\n\nBut the noms don’t include one of the most talked-about films of 2024 or its trans star. More on that below.\n\nVying for the Outstanding Wide-Release Film prize are *Cuckoo, Drive-Away Dolls, Love Lies Bleeding, Mean Girls, My Old Ass, Problemista, Queer *and *Wicked*. Up for the Limited-Release Film award are *20,000 Species of Bees, Backspot, Before I Change My Mind, Big Boys, Close to You, Crossing, Fitting In, High Tide, Housekeeping for Beginners *and *A Place of Our Own*.\n\nNoticeably absent from the GLAAD noms is Jacques Audiard’s Oscar contender * Emilia Pérez*, which\n\n[won the Golden Globe](https://deadline.com/2025/01/golden-globes-2025-winners-list-1236246217/)this month, and its trans star Karla Sofía Gascón, who also won a Globe and is up\n\n[for SAG](https://deadline.com/2025/01/sag-awards-nominations-2025-1236249911/)and\n\n[BAFTA awards](https://deadline.com/2025/01/bafta-nominations-conclave-emilia-perez-wicked-hugh-grant-1236257429/)in February. Back in November, GLAAD put out an article titled\n\n[“‘Emilia Pérez’ is Not Good Trans Representation,”](https://glaad.org/emilia-perez-is-not-good-trans-representation/)labeling the film — among other things — a “profoundly retrograde portrayal of a trans woman” and calling it “a step backward.”\n\n### Watch on Deadline\n\nDespite the snub for its *Emilia Pérez*, Netflix still dominated the GLAAD noms with 27 to lead all networks and platforms. ABC was the only other to muster double digits, with 10. Prime Video got nine, and Hulu and CBS took eight apiece.\n\nHere are the nominees for the 2025 [GLAAD Media Awards](https://deadline.com/tag/glaad-media-awards/):\n\n**Outstanding Film – Wide Theatrical Release**Cuckoo (Neon)\n\nDrive-Away Dolls (Focus Features)\n\nLove Lies Bleeding (A24)\n\nMean Girls (Paramou…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 317 words out of ~3020.

The competition in this category includes films such as \"20,000 Species of Bees,\" \"Backspot,\" \"Before I Change My Mind,\" \"Big Boys,\" \"Close to You,\" \"Fitting In,\" \"High Tide,\" \"Housekeeping for Beginners,\" and \"A Place of Our Own.\"\n\nThe GLAAD Media Awards evaluate nominees based on fair, accurate, and inclusive representations of the LGBTQ community, boldness and originality, cultural impact, and overall quality. The selection process involves over 700 voters and volunteers, with results certified by a review panel.\n\nGiven that \"Crossing\" has been nominated, it is recognized for meeting the criteria to a significant extent. However, without specific insights into the critical reception and cultural impact of \"Crossing\" compared to its competitors, it's challenging to determine its likelihood of winning precisely.\n\nConsidering the competitive nature of the category and the fact that \"Crossing\" is one of several nominees, I estimate the probability of \"Crossing\" winning the award to be moderate.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1"
