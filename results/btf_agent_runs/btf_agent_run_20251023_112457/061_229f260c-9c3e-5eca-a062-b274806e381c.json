  "question": "Will Walmart have a higher market cap than Tesla on March 29, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.45,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here's a summary of the current situation regarding the market capitalization of Walmart and Tesla:\n\n1. **Current Market Capitalization:**\n   - As of the latest data, Walmart's market cap is approximately $689.369 billion, with some sources indicating it may have increased to $701.15 billion.\n   - Tesla's market cap is reported to be around $765.56 billion.\n\n2. **Recent Trends:**\n   - Tesla has experienced significant fluctuations in its market cap over the past year, with a high of $1.30 trillion and a low of $559.85 billion.\n   - Tesla's stock price has been volatile, with a 52-week high of $488.54 and a low of $138.80.\n   - Tesla's quarterly earnings growth year-over-year is -70.80%, indicating a significant decline in earnings, which could impact investor sentiment and market cap negatively.\n\n3. **Valuation and Earnings:**\n   - Tesla's trailing P/E ratio is 116.67, suggesting a high valuation relative to its earnings.\n   - Walmart's trailing P/E ratio is 36.29, indicating a more stable valuation compared to Tesla.\n   - Walmart's revenue is significantly higher at $680.98 billion compared to Tesla's $96.8 billion, reflecting its large scale of operations.\n\n4. **Market Sentiment and Outlook:**\n   - Both Tesla and Walmart are currently rated as overvalued, with Tesla having a valuation rating of 96 and Walmart 87.\n   - Tesla experienced a +7.14% price change recently, while Walmart's price change was -0.41% for the same period.\n\nGiven this information, Tesla currently has a higher market cap than Walmart, but the volatility and recent decline in Tesla's earnings could affect its market cap in the near future. Walmart's stable operations and profitability might help it maintain or increase its market cap.\n\nConsidering these factors, the probability that Walmart will have a higher market cap than Tesla on March 29, 2025, is moderate but not certain. \n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.45",

The rating of 1 to 100, where 1 is best and 100 is worst, is divided into thirds. The first third (a green rating of 1-33) indicates that the ticker is undervalued; the second third (a grey number between 34 and 66) means that the ticker is valued fairly; and the last third (red number of 67 to 100) reflects that the ticker is undervalued. We use an FA Score to show how many ratings show the ticker to be undervalued (green) or overvalued (red).\n\n**TSLA**’s FA Score shows that 1 FA rating(s) are green while**WMT**’s FA Score has 2 green FA rating(s).\n\nIt is best to consider a short-term outlook for a ticker by using Technical Analysis (TA) indicators. We use Odds of Success as the percentage of outcomes which confirm successful trade signals in the past.\n\nIf the Odds of Success (the likelihood of the continuation of a trend) for each indicator are greater than 50%, then the generated signal is confirmed. A green percentage from 90% to 51% indicates that the ticker is in a bullish trend. A red percentage from 90% - 51% indicates that the ticker is in a bearish trend. All grey percentages are below 50% and are considered not to confirm the trend signal.\n\n**TSLA**’s TA Score shows that 4 TA indicator(s) are bullish while **WMT**’s TA Score has 4 bullish TA indicator(s).\n\n**TSLA** (@Motor Vehicles) experienced а +7.14% price change this week, while **WMT** (@Discount Stores) price change was -0.41% for the same time period.\n\nThe average weekly price growth across all stocks in the **@Motor Vehicles** industry was +1.60%.

Walmart's stable operations and profitability might help it maintain or increase its market cap.\n\nConsidering these factors, the probability that Walmart will have a higher market cap than Tesla on March 29, 2025, is moderate but not certain. \n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.45"
