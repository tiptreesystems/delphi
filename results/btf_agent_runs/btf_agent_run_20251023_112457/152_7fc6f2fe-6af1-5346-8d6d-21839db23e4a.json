  "question": "In its March update, will Similarweb report chatgpt.com having a higher rank than wikipedia.org?",
  "probability": 0.2,
  "reasoning": "Based on the evidence gathered:\n\n1. **Current Rankings**: As of February 2025, chatgpt.com is ranked below wikipedia.org in the list of most-visited websites. Wikipedia.org is listed before chatgpt.com, indicating a higher position in the rankings.\n\n2. **Traffic Data**: ChatGPT.com receives approximately 4.7 billion visits per month, whereas Wikipedia.org receives approximately 7.09 billion visits per month as of February 2025. This suggests that Wikipedia.org has significantly more traffic than ChatGPT.com.\n\n3. **Growth Trends**: Although ChatGPT's traffic and usage have been growing strongly, it is still behind Wikipedia in terms of total visits.\n\nGiven the current data and trends, it seems unlikely that chatgpt.com will surpass wikipedia.org in the Similarweb rankings by the March 2025 update.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.2",
