  "question": "Will Argentina's Chamber of Deputies impeach President Javier Milei before April 1, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.35,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here is a summary of the current situation regarding the potential impeachment of President Javier Milei:\n\n1. **Impeachment Calls**: There are strong calls from opposition lawmakers in Argentina for the impeachment of President Javier Milei. These calls are primarily due to his promotion of the $LIBRA cryptocurrency, which resulted in significant financial losses for investors.\n\n2. **Legal and Political Actions**: Multiple legal actions have been initiated, including fraud charges against President Milei. A federal prosecutor has opened an investigation targeting him, and there are ongoing discussions about his potential involvement in a \"rug pull\" scam.\n\n3. **Constitutional Requirements**: For impeachment to proceed, a two-thirds majority in the Chamber of Deputies is required. While there is significant political pressure and public outcry, achieving this majority is a substantial hurdle.\n\n4. **International and Domestic Pressure**: The incident has attracted international attention, and there are ongoing efforts to arrest individuals involved in the cryptocurrency's launch. This adds to the political pressure on Milei.\n\n5. **Current Political Climate**: The political climate in Argentina is tense, with accusations of fraud and corruption. The opposition is actively pursuing impeachment, but it is unclear if they have the necessary support to achieve the required majority in the Chamber of Deputies.\n\nGiven the above factors, while there is significant momentum and political will to impeach President Milei, the constitutional requirement of a two-thirds majority poses a significant challenge. The situation is dynamic, and developments could sway the outcome either way.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.35",

His post linked to a website where the digital coin could be bought, the domain name of which included Milei’s popular catchphrase “long live freedom”.\n\n“The world wants to invest in [Argentina](https://www.theguardian.com/world/argentina),” Milei added in the post to his more than 3.8 million followers.\n\nThe token immediately [soared in value](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/16/americas/argentina-milei-libra-cryptocurrency-impeachment-calls-intl-latam/index.html), from almost zero at the time of its launch to nearly $5, before plummeting to under $1, [according to trading sites](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/argentinas-opposition-threatens-impeachment-trial-after-milei-touts-crypto-coin-2025-02-16/). Argentina’s [fintech chamber](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/argentinas-opposition-threatens-impeachment-trial-after-milei-touts-crypto-coin-2025-02-16/) said that the case could amount to a “rug pull” – a scam which sees cryptocurrency rapidly inflated, or “pumped”, before crashing while insiders “dump” their stake, making the tokens worthless. Other economists and crypto specialists said the digital asset could be a fraud or Ponzi scheme.\n\nMilei deleted his post hours later, saying he was “not aware of the details of the project”, but the scandal has nonetheless sparked a political firestorm, and the federal prosecutor…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 266 words out of ~768.

The largest stakeholders had sold their coins, leaving almost everyone else with a collective $250 million in losses.\n\nTo cryptocurrency veterans, it was a classic “rug-pull.” A celebrity touts a new digital coin, prices soar and then insiders who own most of the coins pull the rug: They sell their stakes for a big profit at the expense of amateur investors who got in later.\n\nTo Argentina, it was a national scandal. The president, critics said, had just scammed his constituents. The opposition called for impeachment. Argentine citizens filed a dozen criminal complaints. A federal prosecutor opened an investigation, with Mr. Milei as a target.\n\nThen Mr. Milei left for Washington. At the Conservative Political Action Conference on Saturday, he gave a combative speech ahead of President Trump, the other president who promoted a new cryptocurrency this year that [soared](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/19/us/politics/trump-cryptocurrency-surges.html) and then crashed.

The token launch was not publicised by the company, but a few minutes after its creation Argentina's President [Javier Milei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javier_Milei \"Javier Milei\") published on his official Instagram, Twitter and Facebook accounts, promoting it.\n\n![](https://metaculus-web-media.s3.amazonaws.com/user_uploaded/0h9ZcPTAhdLnYSEVW.jpg.webp)\n\n\\[Translation:\n\nLiberal Argentina is growing!!!\nThis private project will be dedicated to promoting the growth of the Argentine economy by funding small businesses and Argentine entrepreneurs.\nThe world wants to invest in Argentina.\n\nvivalalibertadproject.com\n\nContract: Bo9jh3wsmcC2AjakLWzNmKJ3SgtZmXEcSaW7L2FAvUsU\n\n\\$LIBRA\n\nLONG LIVE FREEDOM, DAMN IT...!!!]\n\nThe value of the token surged to \\$5.20 and plummeted shortly thereafter, the price plummeted, resulting in approximately \\$87 million in losses for around 74,000 investors.\n\nMilei then posted [the following tweet](https://x.com/JMilei/status/1890606683291779195) (translated):\n\n> A few hours ago I posted a tweet, as I have so many other times, supporting a supposed private enterprise with which I obviously have no connection whatsoever.\n> ‎\n> I was not aware of the details of the project and after having become aware of it I decided not to continue spreading the word (that is why I deleted the tweet).\n> ‎\n> To the filthy rats of the political caste who want to take advantage of this situation to do harm, I want to say that every day they confirm how vile politicians are, and they increase our conviction to kick them in the ass.\n> ‎\n> VLLC!\n\nA timeline of the events can be found [here](https://cenital.com/el-minuto-a-minuto-del-memecoin-que-promociono-milei/) (in Spanish).\n\nOpposition members have accused Milei of a rug pull and [have claimed](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp9x9j89evxo) that they will initiate impeachment proceedings.

      "content": "Based on the gathered evidence, here is a summary of the current situation regarding the potential impeachment of President Javier Milei:\n\n1. **Impeachment Calls**: There are strong calls from opposition lawmakers in Argentina for the impeachment of President Javier Milei. These calls are primarily due to his promotion of the $LIBRA cryptocurrency, which resulted in significant financial losses for investors.\n\n2. **Legal and Political Actions**: Multiple legal actions have been initiated, including fraud charges against President Milei. A federal prosecutor has opened an investigation targeting him, and there are ongoing discussions about his potential involvement in a \"rug pull\" scam.\n\n3. **Constitutional Requirements**: For impeachment to proceed, a two-thirds majority in the Chamber of Deputies is required. While there is significant political pressure and public outcry, achieving this majority is a substantial hurdle.\n\n4. **International and Domestic Pressure**: The incident has attracted international attention, and there are ongoing efforts to arrest individuals involved in the cryptocurrency's launch. This adds to the political pressure on Milei.\n\n5. **Current Political Climate**: The political climate in Argentina is tense, with accusations of fraud and corruption. The opposition is actively pursuing impeachment, but it is unclear if they have the necessary support to achieve the required majority in the Chamber of Deputies.\n\nGiven the above factors, while there is significant momentum and political will to impeach President Milei, the constitutional requirement of a two-thirds majority poses a significant challenge. The situation is dynamic, and developments could sway the outcome either way.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.35"
