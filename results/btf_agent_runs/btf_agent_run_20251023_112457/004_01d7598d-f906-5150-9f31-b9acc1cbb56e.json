  "question": "Will Mahmoud Khalil be deported before April 1, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.1,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered information, here are the key points relevant to whether Mahmoud Khalil will be deported before April 1, 2025:\n\n1. **Court Orders Blocking Deportation**: Multiple court orders have been issued to block Mahmoud Khalil's deportation pending judicial review. This includes orders from District Judge Jesse Furman and Judge Michael E. Farbiarz, indicating strong legal barriers against immediate deportation.\n\n2. **Strong Legal Support**: Khalil's legal team is supported by prominent organizations such as the ACLU, NYCLU, and the Center for Constitutional Rights. This suggests a robust defense against deportation efforts.\n\n3. **Public and International Attention**: The case has drawn significant public attention, with over three million signatures on a petition for his release and calls from UN experts for his immediate release. This international and public pressure may influence the U.S. government's actions.\n\n4. **Political Context**: The Trump administration has shown interest in deporting individuals involved in pro-Palestinian activism, but the legal and public opposition may outweigh these efforts in the short term.\n\n5. **Current Detention Status**: Khalil remains detained in a Louisiana ICE facility, but his deportation is currently blocked by court orders.\n\nGiven the strong legal barriers, public support, and international attention, it seems unlikely that Mahmoud Khalil will be deported before April 1, 2025.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1",

      "content": "Based on the gathered information, here are the key points relevant to whether Mahmoud Khalil will be deported before April 1, 2025:\n\n1. **Court Orders Blocking Deportation**: Multiple court orders have been issued to block Mahmoud Khalil's deportation pending judicial review. This includes orders from District Judge Jesse Furman and Judge Michael E. Farbiarz, indicating strong legal barriers against immediate deportation.\n\n2. **Strong Legal Support**: Khalil's legal team is supported by prominent organizations such as the ACLU, NYCLU, and the Center for Constitutional Rights. This suggests a robust defense against deportation efforts.\n\n3. **Public and International Attention**: The case has drawn significant public attention, with over three million signatures on a petition for his release and calls from UN experts for his immediate release. This international and public pressure may influence the U.S. government's actions.\n\n4. **Political Context**: The Trump administration has shown interest in deporting individuals involved in pro-Palestinian activism, but the legal and public opposition may outweigh these efforts in the short term.\n\n5. **Current Detention Status**: Khalil remains detained in a Louisiana ICE facility, but his deportation is currently blocked by court orders.\n\nGiven the strong legal barriers, public support, and international attention, it seems unlikely that Mahmoud Khalil will be deported before April 1, 2025.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1"
