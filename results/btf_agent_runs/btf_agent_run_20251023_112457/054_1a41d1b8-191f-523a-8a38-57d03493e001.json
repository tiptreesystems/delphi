The search for news about Stripe's IPO plans in February 2025 yielded articles discussing the possibility of an IPO, but they do not confirm any official announcement. Additionally, there were no results from Stripe's newsroom indicating an IPO announcement, and no information about an SEC Form S-1 filing by Stripe was found.\n\nGiven this information, it seems unlikely that Stripe has announced plans for an IPO as of now.
