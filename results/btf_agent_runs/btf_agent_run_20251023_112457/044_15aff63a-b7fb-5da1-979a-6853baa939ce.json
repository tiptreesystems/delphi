  "question": "Will Michael Jordan's net worth exceed that of Starbucks founder Howard Schultz on March 31, 2025? ",
  "probability": 0.95,
  "reasoning": "Based on the information gathered:\n\n1. **Michael Jordan's Net Worth**: As of 2025, Michael Jordan's net worth is estimated to be $3.5 billion. His wealth is largely derived from his successful NBA career, lucrative brand endorsements, and business ventures, including a significant partnership with Nike. He earns approximately $300-400 million annually from various business deals, with a substantial portion coming from his Nike partnership, which brings in around $60 million each year.\n\n2. **Howard Schultz's Net Worth**: As of March 17, 2025, Howard Schultz's estimated net worth is at least $2.1 billion. The majority of his wealth is tied to his stock holdings in Starbucks Corp, which constitute 99.77% of his total net worth. His stock holdings in Starbucks are valued at over $2.1 billion, and he also holds shares in Dreamworks Animation SKG Inc valued at $5 million.\n\nGiven these facts, Michael Jordan's net worth is significantly higher than Howard Schultz's as of the latest available data in March 2025. Therefore, it is highly likely that Michael Jordan's net worth will exceed Howard Schultz's on March 31, 2025.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.95",
