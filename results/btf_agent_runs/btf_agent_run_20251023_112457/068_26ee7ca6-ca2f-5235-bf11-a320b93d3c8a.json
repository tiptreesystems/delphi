  "question": "Will PEPFAR funding be resumed before April 7, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.3,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here are the key points regarding the resumption of PEPFAR funding:\n\n1. **Supreme Court Ruling**: The Supreme Court rejected a request by the Trump administration to continue freezing nearly $2 billion in foreign aid, including PEPFAR funding. However, the court's decision did not specify when the money must be released, allowing further disputes in lower courts. This indicates that while there is legal pressure to resume funding, the timeline remains uncertain.\n\n2. **Current Status of PEPFAR Programs**: As of March 2025, the vast majority of USAID-funded programs, including PEPFAR, have received termination notices despite a limited waiver for some activities. This waiver does not cover HIV prevention activities outside of vertical transmission, and the impact of the stop-work orders is expected to be severe.\n\n3. **Congressional Reauthorization**: PEPFAR's congressional reauthorization expired as of March 25, 2025, creating uncertainty about its future. While programs can continue under annual appropriations, the lack of a long-term legislative framework adds to the instability.\n\n4. **Impact on Global Health**: The World Health Organization warned of potential HIV medication shortages in eight countries due to USAID cuts, highlighting the critical impact of funding instability on global health programs.\n\n5. **Ongoing Review**: The Trump administration's 90-day review of foreign aid, including PEPFAR, is set to conclude by April 20, 2025. This review is expected to provide clarity on PEPFAR's future priorities and broader U.S. foreign aid strategy.\n\nGiven these points, the probability of PEPFAR funding resuming at least 50% of pre-pause levels before April 7, 2025, is uncertain. The legal and administrative processes are ongoing, and while there is some pressure to resume funding, significant obstacles remain.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.3",

Prior to 2024, bipartisan support had secured five-year reauthorizations in 2008, 2013, and 2018. Last year, Congress allowed only a [one-year authorization](https://www.thinkglobalhealth.org/article/pepfar-hiv-program-gets-yearlong-lifeline-whats-next) as political strife engulfed PEPFAR.\n\nWithout reauthorization, PEPFAR sits in purgatory—even though Congress appropriated funding through the end of September via the continuing resolution that [passed this month](https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/fact-sheet/congress-passes-full-year-continuing-resolution-bill-maintaining-global-health-funding-at-prior-year-levels/). The expiration of its authorization introduces deep uncertainty about its long-term future, meaning that officials could now terminate or significantly curtail PEPFAR at any time.\n\nHealth ministries, implementing partners, and community-based organizations across PEPFAR-supported countries must try to deliver lifesaving care without the stability that long-term U.S. commitments once provided. At the same time, structural questions remain about how the State Department will operate PEPFAR amid [reported](https://www.devex.com/news/memo-lays-out-plan-to-replace-usaid-with-new-humanitarian-agency-109685) proposals to create a new U.S. Agency for International Humanitarian Assistance. The question now is not just whether PEPFAR will continue, but also how it must evolve to remain effective in a drastically reshaped foreign aid landscape.\n\n#### A Moment of Political Paralysis and Global Consequences\n\nThe expiration of PEPFAR's authorization is a symptom of a broader shift in U.S. foreign assistance policy.

Prior to 2024, bipartisan support had secured five-year reauthorizations in 2008, 2013, and 2018.

      "content": "Based on the following question, analyze it carefully and provide your probability estimate.\n\nQuestion: Will PEPFAR funding be resumed before April 7, 2025?\nBackground: PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief, is a United States governmental initiative to address the global HIV/AIDS epidemic. Launched by U.S. President George W. Bush in 2003, [as of April 2024](https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/fact-sheet/the-u-s-presidents-emergency-plan-for-aids-relief-pepfar/) PEPFAR had provided about \\$120 billion in cumulative funding for HIV/AIDS treatment, prevention, and research since its inception, making it the largest global health program focused on a single disease in history until the COVID-19 pandemic. PEPFAR [has saved](https://theconversation.com/pepfar-funding-to-fight-hiv-aids-has-saved-26-million-lives-since-2003-how-cutting-it-will-hurt-africa-250413) over 26 million lives, primarily in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nOn January 20, 2025, President Donald J. Trump [signed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/reevaluating-and-realigning-united-states-foreign-aid/) an executive order pausing for 90 days new foreign aid disbursements [including for the PEPFAR program](https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/the-status-of-president-trumps-pause-of-foreign-aid-and-implications-for-pepfar-and-other-global-health-programs/), pending a review of all foreign assistance programs. On February 13, 2025, federal judge Amir Ali [ordered](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/judge-orders-trump-administration-reinstate-foreign-aid-funding-now-rcna192168) the Trump Administration to resume foreign aid programs in place before Trump's inauguration. On February 20, 2025, Judge Ali [ruled](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-administration-not-complying-foreign-aid-amir-ali-rcna193092) that the Trump Administration was not fully in compliance with the order.\n\nAfter a long bipartisan consensus about the program's usefulness, in recent years PEPFAR has faced [increased opposition](https://rollcall.com/2023/09/21/pepfar-reauthorization-debate-highlights-splits-in-gop/) in the US Congress, particularly from members of the Republican Party. In 2024 PEPFAR [received](https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/pepfars-short-term-reauthorization-sets-an-uncertain-course-for-its-long-term-future/) temporary reauthorization from Congress amid the increasing opposition. See for example [this report](https://www.heritage.org/budget-and-spending/report/reassessing-americas-30-billion-global-aids-relief-program) from the Heritage Foundation.\n\nAccording to [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/pepfar-funding-to-fight-hiv-aids-has-saved-26-million-lives-since-2003-how-cutting-it-will-hurt-africa-250413) on March 4, 2025:&#x20;\n\n> \\[A]s of this writing, despite a [court order](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69628254/21/global-health-council-v-donald-j-trump/) to resume funding, it remains entirely frozen, and most programmes are still shut down. The day after the court ordered the government to pay [nearly US\\$2 billion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/25/usaid-funding-trump-administration-court/) it owes organisations for work already done, the administration revealed that it had terminated the vast majority of foreign assistance awards, [including some for Pepfar](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/us/politics/trump-usaid-foreign-aid.html). Details have not been made public. Meanwhile, the [US Supreme Court put a short-term pause](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/us/politics/trump-usaid-foreign-aid.html) on the lower court’s order to immediately pay the money already owed.\nResolution criteria: This question will resolve as **Yes** if, before April 7, 2025, [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) report that funding for the United States President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which is frozen ([NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/us/politics/trump-hiv-aids-pepfar.html), [JIAS](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11851316/), [Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/03/05/congress/graham-warns-trumps-budget-pick-about-going-too-far-with-funding-freeze-00213662)) at the time of this question, has resumed. If a partial resumption takes place, this question will resolve as **Yes** PEPFAR's funding levels are at least 50% of pre-pause funding.\nFine print: An announcement that funding *will* resume will only resolve this question if the date of the resumption is before April 7, 2025 and no credible sources as of that date suggest that funding remains paused.&#x20;\npresent_date: 2025-03-26T22:59:10.845374\n\n\nMake sure to use the tools at your disposal to gather relevant information before providing your final probability estimate.\n\nYou may reason through the problem, but you MUST end your response with:\nFINAL PROBABILITY: [your decimal number between 0 and 1]"

On February 20, 2025, Judge Ali ruled that the Trump Administration was not fully in compliance with the order. After a long bipartisan consensus about the program's usefulness, in recent years PEPFAR has faced increased opposition in the US Congress, particularly from members of the Republican Party. In 2024 PEPFAR received temporary reauthorization from Congress amid the increasing opposition.\",\"resolution_criteria\":\"This question will resolve as Yes if, before April 7, 2025, credible sources report that funding for the United States President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which is frozen at the time of this question, has resumed.

Launched by U.S. President George W. Bush in 2003, PEPFAR had provided about $120 billion in cumulative funding for HIV/AIDS treatment, prevention, and research since its inception, making it the largest global health program focused on a single disease in history until the COVID-19 pandemic. PEPFAR has saved over 26 million lives, primarily in Sub-Saharan Africa. On January 20, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed an executive order pausing for 90 days new foreign aid disbursements including for the PEPFAR program, pending a review of all foreign assistance programs. On February 13, 2025, federal judge Amir Ali ordered the Trump Administration to resume foreign aid programs in place before Trump's inauguration. On February 20, 2025, Judge Ali ruled that the Trump Administration was not fully in compliance with the order.

      "content": "Based on the gathered evidence, here are the key points regarding the resumption of PEPFAR funding:\n\n1. **Supreme Court Ruling**: The Supreme Court rejected a request by the Trump administration to continue freezing nearly $2 billion in foreign aid, including PEPFAR funding. However, the court's decision did not specify when the money must be released, allowing further disputes in lower courts. This indicates that while there is legal pressure to resume funding, the timeline remains uncertain.\n\n2. **Current Status of PEPFAR Programs**: As of March 2025, the vast majority of USAID-funded programs, including PEPFAR, have received termination notices despite a limited waiver for some activities. This waiver does not cover HIV prevention activities outside of vertical transmission, and the impact of the stop-work orders is expected to be severe.\n\n3. **Congressional Reauthorization**: PEPFAR's congressional reauthorization expired as of March 25, 2025, creating uncertainty about its future. While programs can continue under annual appropriations, the lack of a long-term legislative framework adds to the instability.\n\n4. **Impact on Global Health**: The World Health Organization warned of potential HIV medication shortages in eight countries due to USAID cuts, highlighting the critical impact of funding instability on global health programs.\n\n5. **Ongoing Review**: The Trump administration's 90-day review of foreign aid, including PEPFAR, is set to conclude by April 20, 2025. This review is expected to provide clarity on PEPFAR's future priorities and broader U.S. foreign aid strategy.\n\nGiven these points, the probability of PEPFAR funding resuming at least 50% of pre-pause levels before April 7, 2025, is uncertain. The legal and administrative processes are ongoing, and while there is some pressure to resume funding, significant obstacles remain.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.3"
