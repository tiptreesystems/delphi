  "question": "Will there be more than 10 people in space on March 29, 2025, according to whoisinspace.com?",
  "probability": 0.1,
  "reasoning": "Based on the information retrieved:\n\n1. **Current Number of People in Space**: As of March 21, 2025, there are 10 people currently living and working in space. This includes 4 astronauts, 3 cosmonauts, and 3 taikonauts. This is confirmed by multiple sources including whoisinspace.com and starlust.org.\n\n2. **Upcoming Missions and Crew Rotations**:\n   - **SpaceX Crew-10** launched on March 14, 2025, with four crew members: Anne McClain, Nichole Ayers, Kirill Peskov, and Takuya Onishi.\n   - The crew rotation schedule indicates that Crew-9 returned to Earth on March 18, 2025, which means that the number of people in space might have temporarily increased during the crew swap but settled back to 10 after Crew-9's departure.\n\n3. **Future Launches**: There are no immediate launches scheduled before March 29, 2025, that would increase the number of people in space beyond 10.\n\nGiven the current data, there are no additional launches or crew swaps scheduled before March 29, 2025, that would increase the number of people in space above 10. Therefore, it is unlikely that the number of people in space will exceed 10 by that date.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1",

Today, that dream has become a reality for a select few.\n\nSo, how many people are in space right now? In this article, we’ll discover the names of the brave men and women currently living and working aboard the [ two space stations currently in orbit around the planet](https://starlust.org/how-many-space-stations-are-currently-in-orbit/).\n\n## As of March 21, 2025 there are 10 people currently living and working in space.\n\n### Here's a quick rundown 👇\n\n- 4 Astronauts\n- 3 Cosmonauts\n- 3 Taikonauts\n\n### By Country 🌍\n\n- 2 Americans 🇺🇸\n- 3 Russians 🇷🇺\n- 3 Chinese 🇨🇳\n- 1 Japanese 🇯🇵\n- 1 Danish 🇩🇰\n\n## There are currently 7 people onboard the ISS\n\nThe crew of the ISS is usually made up of seven people from different countries, reflecting the collaborative and international nature of the space station. When a new crew arrives and departs, there may be a temporary overlap period during which the number of crew members exceeds the usual limit.\n\n### Oleg Kononenko\n\nISS commander\n\nOleg Dmitriyevich Kononenko is a highly experienced Russian cosmonaut who has undertaken five missions to the International Space Station, serving variously as a flight engineer and commander, and accumulating over 788 days in orbit, the most of any currently active cosmonaut or astronaut\n\n**Oleg joined the ISS via the Soyuz MS-24 spacecraft. He has been in space since September 2023.**\n\n### Nikolai Chub\n\nFlight Engineer\n\nNikolay Aleksandrovich Chub is a Russian cosmonaut selected by Roscosmos in 2012, who rose through the ranks after excelling in management and informatics, as well as economics, and heading the company Space Tu, LLC. Chub has faced challenges such as initially being denied a U.S. visa critical for ISS safety training but was later granted entry, and after serving as a backup for several missions.\n\n**Nikolai joined the ISS via the Soyuz MS-24 spacecraft.

      "content": "Based on the information retrieved:\n\n1. **Current Number of People in Space**: As of March 21, 2025, there are 10 people currently living and working in space. This includes 4 astronauts, 3 cosmonauts, and 3 taikonauts. This is confirmed by multiple sources including whoisinspace.com and starlust.org.\n\n2. **Upcoming Missions and Crew Rotations**:\n   - **SpaceX Crew-10** launched on March 14, 2025, with four crew members: Anne McClain, Nichole Ayers, Kirill Peskov, and Takuya Onishi.\n   - The crew rotation schedule indicates that Crew-9 returned to Earth on March 18, 2025, which means that the number of people in space might have temporarily increased during the crew swap but settled back to 10 after Crew-9's departure.\n\n3. **Future Launches**: There are no immediate launches scheduled before March 29, 2025, that would increase the number of people in space beyond 10.\n\nGiven the current data, there are no additional launches or crew swaps scheduled before March 29, 2025, that would increase the number of people in space above 10. Therefore, it is unlikely that the number of people in space will exceed 10 by that date.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1"
