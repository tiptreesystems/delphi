  "question": "Will Mean Girls win the 2025 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Film -- Wide Release?",
  "probability": 0.35,
  "reasoning": "Based on the information gathered:\n\n1. **Nomination**: \"Mean Girls\" is nominated for the Outstanding Film – Wide Theatrical Release category at the 36th Annual GLAAD Media Awards. Other nominees in this category include \"Cuckoo\", \"Drive-Away Dolls\", \"Love Lies Bleeding\", \"My Old Ass\", \"Problemista\", \"Queer\", and \"Wicked\".\n\n2. **LGBTQ Representation**: The 2024 \"Mean Girls\" movie has been noted for its increased representation of LGBTQ+ characters, particularly with Janis being canonically queer. This aligns well with GLAAD's criteria for fair, accurate, and inclusive representations of the LGBTQ community.\n\n3. **Cultural Impact**: The film's cultural impact is significant, given its nostalgic ties to the original movie and its adaptation from a popular Broadway musical. The casting of openly queer actors and the film's reception as a fun and inclusive reboot could contribute positively to its chances of winning a GLAAD Media Award.\n\n4. **Competition**: The competition in the category includes films like \"Wicked\" and \"Queer\", which might also have strong LGBTQ representation and cultural impact.\n\n5. **Selection Process**: The GLAAD Media Awards are determined by over 700 voters and volunteers, with a review panel certifying the final list of recipients. This process emphasizes fair, accurate, and inclusive representations, boldness and originality, cultural impact, and overall quality.\n\nConsidering these factors, \"Mean Girls\" has a strong chance due to its alignment with GLAAD's criteria and its cultural significance. However, the presence of other strong contenders means the outcome is not certain.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.35",

Finally.\n\nBut let’s back up a little. As a person of a certain age (that age being millennial), *Mean Girls* has been part of my life for the past 20 years. Which is an insane number to type out, but it’s true. Although we didn’t know each other, Nic and I (Valerie Anne) were both in our final semester of sophomore year when this movie came out, getting ready to become juniors like the girls in the movie. It was hilarious, it was quotable, and I was instantly obsessed. My friends and I constantly expressed our disapproval by saying “boo, you whore” for years. We would regularly call things “grool” and “fetch” when we were trying to be unserious. Over the years my friend groups would change but our shorthand would be the same. As I grew up and came out, my queer friends and I would often call ourselves “too gay to function.” We would randomly shout “I’ve got a big LESBIAN crush on you” to make each other laugh. “The limit does not exist” was just a phrase we used to express our capacity for fangirling. It was, and frankly still is, part of the fabric of our existence. This was only amplified by the movie becoming a Broadway musical in 2018. It borrowed the same overarching plot as the movie (teenagers being cliquey and bullying each other is, unfortunately, timeless content), but punched it up with catchy songs.\n\nAnd then came the 2024 movie. Reboots are hard. Turning a musical into a movie is hard. So being a movie turned musical turned movie musical, *Mean Girls* (2024) had a lot of hurdles to overcome. It gracefully leaps over some and stumbles over others, and that’s what Nic and I are here to discuss today. One thing is for certain though: this is the gayest adaptation of *Mean Girls* yet.\n\n**Valerie Anne:** My friends and I were deeply into the original *Mean Girls* movie.

More on that below.\n\nVying for the Outstanding Wide-Release Film prize are *Cuckoo, Drive-Away Dolls, Love Lies Bleeding, Mean Girls, My Old Ass, Problemista, Queer *and *Wicked*. Up for the Limited-Release Film award are *20,000 Species of Bees, Backspot, Before I Change My Mind, Big Boys, Close to You, Crossing, Fitting In, High Tide, Housekeeping for Beginners *and *A Place of Our Own*.\n\nNoticeably absent from the GLAAD noms is Jacques Audiard’s Oscar contender * Emilia Pérez*, which\n\n[won the Golden Globe](https://deadline.com/2025/01/golden-globes-2025-winners-list-1236246217/)this month, and its trans star Karla Sofía Gascón, who also won a Globe and is up\n\n[for SAG](https://deadline.com/2025/01/sag-awards-nominations-2025-1236249911/)and\n\n[BAFTA awards](https://deadline.com/2025/01/bafta-nominations-conclave-emilia-perez-wicked-hugh-grant-1236257429/)in February.

ABC was the only other to muster double digits, with 10. Prime Video got nine, and Hulu and CBS took eight apiece.\n\nHere are the nominees for the 2025 [GLAAD Media Awards](https://deadline.com/tag/glaad-media-awards/):\n\n**Outstanding Film – Wide Theatrical Release**Cuckoo (Neon)\n\nDrive-Away Dolls (Focus Features)\n\nLove Lies Bleeding (A24)\n\nMean Girls (Paramou…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 317 words out of ~3020.

Finally.\n\nBut let’s back up a little. As a person of a certain age (that age being millennial), *Mean Girls* has been part of my life for the past 20 years. Which is an insane number to type out, but it’s true. Although we didn’t know each other, Nic and I (Valerie Anne) were both in our final semester of sophomore year when this movie came out, getting ready to become juniors like the girls in the movie. It was hilarious, it was quotable, and I was instantly obsessed. My friends and I constantly expressed our disapproval by saying “boo, you whore” for years. We would regularly call things “grool” and “fetch” when we were trying to be unserious. Over the years my friend groups would change but our shorthand would be the same. As I grew up and came out, my queer friends and I would often call ourselves “too gay to function.” We would randomly shout “I’ve got a big LESBIAN crush on you” to make each other laugh. “The limit does not exist” was just a phrase we used to express our capacity for fangirling. It was, and frankly still is, part of the fabric of our existence. This was only amplified by the movie becoming a Broadway musical in 2018. It borrowed the same overarching plot as the movie (teenagers being cliquey and bullying each other is, unfortunately, timeless content), but punched it up with catchy songs.\n\nAnd then came the 2024 movie. Reboots are hard. Turning a musical into a movie is hard. So being a movie turned musical turned movie musical, *Mean Girls* (2024) had a lot of hurdles to overcome. It gracefully leaps over some and stumbles over others, and that’s what Nic and I are here to discuss today. One thing is for certain though: this is the gayest adaptation of *Mean Girls* yet.\n\n**Valerie Anne:** My friends and I were deeply into the original *Mean Girls* movie.

Although we didn\\u2019t know each other, Nic and I (Valerie Anne) were both in our final semester of sophomore year when this movie came out, getting ready to become juniors like the girls in the movie. It was hilarious, it was quotable, and I was instantly obsessed. My friends and I constantly expressed our disapproval by saying \\u201cboo, you whore\\u201d for years. We would regularly call things \\u201cgrool\\u201d and \\u201cfetch\\u201d when we were trying to be unserious. Over the years my friend groups would change but our shorthand would be the same. As I grew up and came out, my queer friends and I would often call ourselves \\u201ctoo gay to function.\\u201d We would randomly shout \\u201cI\\u2019ve got a big LESBIAN crush on you\\u201d to make each other laugh. \\u201cThe limit does not exist\\u201d was just a phrase we used to express our capacity for fangirling. It was, and frankly still is, part of the fabric of our existence. This was only amplified by the movie becoming a Broadway musical in 2018. It borrowed the same overarching plot as the movie (teenagers being cliquey and bullying each other is, unfortunately, timeless content), but punched it up with catchy songs.\\n\\nAnd then came the 2024 movie. Reboots are hard. Turning a musical into a movie is hard. So being a movie turned musical turned movie musical, *Mean Girls* (2024) had a lot of hurdles to overcome. It gracefully leaps over some and stumbles over others, and that\\u2019s what Nic and I are here to discuss today. One thing is for certain though: this is the gayest adaptation of *Mean Girls* yet.\\n\\n**Valerie Anne:** My friends and I were deeply into the original *Mean Girls* movie.
