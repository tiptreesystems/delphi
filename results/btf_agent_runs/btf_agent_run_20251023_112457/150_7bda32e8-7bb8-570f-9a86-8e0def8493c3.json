  "question": "Will the difference between the Arena Score of o3 and the next best model on Chatbot Arena be greater than 15.0 on April 5, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.05,
  "reasoning": "Based on the information gathered, here are the key points relevant to the question:\n\n1. As of March 20, 2025, the highest-ranked model on the Chatbot Arena leaderboard is GPT-4.5-Preview with an Arena Elo score of 1404.\n2. The o3-mini model, which is a version of the o3 series, has an Arena Elo score of 1304.\n3. The next best model after GPT-4.5-Preview is Gemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking-Exp-01-21 with an Arena Elo score of 1398.\n4. The difference between the top-ranked model (GPT-4.5-Preview) and the o3-mini model is currently 100 points.\n5. There is no mention of a full version of o3 being ranked on the leaderboard as of the latest update.\n\nGiven these facts, the o3-mini model is significantly behind the top models on the leaderboard. The current difference between the top-ranked model and the o3-mini is 100 points, which is much greater than the 15-point threshold required for a YES resolution. However, the question specifically asks about the difference between the highest-ranked version of o3 and the next best model, not the top model.\n\nSince the o3-mini is the only version of o3 mentioned and it is not the top model, the question would resolve as a negative number if the situation remains the same by April 5, 2025. There is no indication that a full version of o3 will be ranked and surpass the 15-point difference with the next best model by the resolution date.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the difference between the Arena Score of o3 and the next best model on Chatbot Arena will be greater than 15.0 on April 5, 2025, is very low.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.05",

It uses an Elo rating system similar to the one used in chess to rank LLMs by their capabilities. Rankings are based on user ratings of different LLM systems. Besides general rankings, Chatbot Arena has added various more narrow categories, such as Hard Prompts, Instruction Following, or Math. o3 is the latest model developed by OpenAI, announced on the \\\"12th day of OpenAI\\\" on December 20, 2024. Is is a successor to o1, a series of models trained to use chain of thought to solve complex problems. According to OpenAI, o3 performs significantly better in math, coding, and various other benchmarks than all currently released models. o3-mini, a more efficient but potentially less intelligent version of o3, is planned to be released in late January or early February 2025.\",\"resolution_criteria\":\"This question will resolve as YES if the Arena Score for the highest-ranked version of o3 minus the Arena Score for the highest-ranked non-o3 model in the Overall category at the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard as of April 5, 2025 is greater than 15.0. If no o3 version is scored on Chatbot Arena on April 5, 2025, this question will be annulled.\",\"fine_print\":\"The Style Control filter will not be used.

As of March 20, 2025, the highest-ranked model on the Chatbot Arena leaderboard is GPT-4.5-Preview with an Arena Elo score of 1404.\n2. The o3-mini model, which is a version of the o3 series, has an Arena Elo score of 1304.\n3. The next best model after GPT-4.5-Preview is Gemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking-Exp-01-21 with an Arena Elo score of 1398.\n4. The difference between the top-ranked model (GPT-4.5-Preview) and the o3-mini model is currently 100 points.\n5. There is no mention of a full version of o3 being ranked on the leaderboard as of the latest update.\n\nGiven these facts, the o3-mini model is significantly behind the top models on the leaderboard. The current difference between the top-ranked model and the o3-mini is 100 points, which is much greater than the 15-point threshold required for a YES resolution. However, the question specifically asks about the difference between the highest-ranked version of o3 and the next best model, not the top model.\n\nSince the o3-mini is the only version of o3 mentioned and it is not the top model, the question would resolve as a negative number if the situation remains the same by April 5, 2025. There is no indication that a full version of o3 will be ranked and surpass the 15-point difference with the next best model by the resolution date.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the difference between the Arena Score of o3 and the next best model on Chatbot Arena will be greater than 15.0 on April 5, 2025, is very low.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.05"
