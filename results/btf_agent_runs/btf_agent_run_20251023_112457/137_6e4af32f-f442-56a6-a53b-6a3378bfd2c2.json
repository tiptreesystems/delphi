  "question": "Will the \"environment\" subreddit have fewer than 1,545,000 subscribers on March 30, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.65,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered information:\n\n1. **Reddit Growth Trends**: Reddit has been experiencing significant growth in its user base. The daily active user count grew by 47.27% since Q3 2023, and the monthly active user base grew by 48.15% since 2022. This indicates a strong overall growth trend on the platform.\n\n2. **Subreddit Activity**: There are over 100,000 active subreddits on Reddit, and the platform registered $872.5 million in annual revenue in Q1-Q3 2024, indicating strong engagement.\n\n3. **Climate-related Discussions**: The proportion of climate-related discussions on Reddit has declined significantly over the years, from up to 1.4% of discussions between 2005 and 2010 to around 0.1% by 2021. However, the absolute number of climate-related discussions has increased, but other topics have grown faster.\n\n4. **Sentiment and Engagement**: Discussions about climate change tend to use more complex vocabulary and are associated with more negative sentiment, which might affect engagement levels.\n\nGiven these insights, the \"environment\" subreddit, which is likely focused on climate and environmental issues, may not be experiencing the same growth as other more popular topics on Reddit. The overall growth of Reddit might not translate to significant growth for the \"environment\" subreddit if it follows the trend of declining proportional interest in climate-related discussions.\n\nConsidering the stagnant to slightly negative growth of the \"environment\" subreddit over the past 6 weeks and the general trends in climate-related discussions, it seems plausible that the subscriber count might not reach 1,545,000 by March 30, 2025.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.65",

However, a systematic review of large-scale online discussions and the terminology used has not been undertaken. Here, we analyze 16 years of Reddit discussions, encompassing 11.5 billion posts, to examine how language surrounding climate change has evolved over time from 2005 to 2021. We applied sentiment analysis, polarity, subjectivity, and readability metrics to discussions of “global warming” and “climate change”. We found that the use of “climate change” surpassed “global warming” in 2013, with “climate change” associated with more negative sentiment and higher subjectivity. Additionally, we observed a decline in the proportion of climate-related discussions over time despite the increasing total number of posts. These findings suggest that public engagement with climate topics on Reddit is waning, and the choice of terminology significantly influences the tone and complexity of the discourse. Our results have important implications for how climate issues are communicated and perceived by the public.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n## Introduction\n\nGlobal environmental change has been discussed in the media for many decades, with varied issues attention 1 and different framing from country to country\n\n.

However, a systematic review of large-scale online discussions and the terminology used has not been undertaken. Here, we analyze 16 years of Reddit discussions, encompassing 11.5 billion posts, to examine how language surrounding climate change has evolved over time from 2005 to 2021. We applied sentiment analysis, polarity, subjectivity, and readability metrics to discussions of \\u201cglobal warming\\u201d and \\u201cclimate change\\u201d. We found that the use of \\u201cclimate change\\u201d surpassed \\u201cglobal warming\\u201d in 2013, with \\u201cclimate change\\u201d associated with more negative sentiment and higher subjectivity. Additionally, we observed a decline in the proportion of climate-related discussions over time despite the increasing total number of posts. These findings suggest that public engagement with climate topics on Reddit is waning, and the choice of terminology significantly influences the tone and complexity of the discourse. Our results have important implications for how climate issues are communicated and perceived by the public.\\n\\n### Similar content being viewed by others\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nGlobal environmental change has been discussed in the media for many decades, with varied issues attention 1 and different framing from country to country\\n\\n.

However, a systematic review of large-scale online discussions and the terminology used has not been undertaken. Here, we analyze 16 years of Reddit discussions, encompassing 11.5 billion posts, to examine how language surrounding climate change has evolved over time from 2005 to 2021. We applied sentiment analysis, polarity, subjectivity, and readability metrics to discussions of \\u001cglobal warming\\u001d and \\u001cclimate change\\u001d. We found that the use of \\u001cclimate change\\u001d surpassed \\u001cglobal warming\\u001d in 2013, with \\u001cclimate change\\u001d associated with more negative sentiment and higher subjectivity. Additionally, we observed a decline in the proportion of climate-related discussions over time despite the increasing total number of posts. These findings suggest that public engagement with climate topics on Reddit is waning, and the choice of terminology significantly influences the tone and complexity of the discourse. Our results have important implications for how climate issues are communicated and perceived by the public.\\n\\n### Similar content being viewed by others\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nGlobal environmental change has been discussed in the media for many decades, with varied issues attention 1 and different framing from country to country\\n\\n.

The daily active user count grew by 47.27% since Q3 2023, and the monthly active user base grew by 48.15% since 2022. This indicates a strong overall growth trend on the platform.\n\n2. **Subreddit Activity**: There are over 100,000 active subreddits on Reddit, and the platform registered $872.5 million in annual revenue in Q1-Q3 2024, indicating strong engagement.\n\n3. **Climate-related Discussions**: The proportion of climate-related discussions on Reddit has declined significantly over the years, from up to 1.4% of discussions between 2005 and 2010 to around 0.1% by 2021. However, the absolute number of climate-related discussions has increased, but other topics have grown faster.\n\n4. **Sentiment and Engagement**: Discussions about climate change tend to use more complex vocabulary and are associated with more negative sentiment, which might affect engagement levels.\n\nGiven these insights, the \"environment\" subreddit, which is likely focused on climate and environmental issues, may not be experiencing the same growth as other more popular topics on Reddit. The overall growth of Reddit might not translate to significant growth for the \"environment\" subreddit if it follows the trend of declining proportional interest in climate-related discussions.\n\nConsidering the stagnant to slightly negative growth of the \"environment\" subreddit over the past 6 weeks and the general trends in climate-related discussions, it seems plausible that the subscriber count might not reach 1,545,000 by March 30, 2025.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.65"
