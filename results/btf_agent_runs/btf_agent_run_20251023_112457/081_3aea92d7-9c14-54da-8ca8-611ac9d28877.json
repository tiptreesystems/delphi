  "question": "Will the DOGE Live Tracker report Savings Per Taxpayer between $500.00 and $750.00 on March 31, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.2,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, the following points are relevant to the question of whether the DOGE Live Tracker will report Savings Per Taxpayer between $500.00 and $750.00 on March 31, 2025:\n\n1. **Inaccuracies in Reported Savings**: Multiple sources, including NPR and The Guardian, have highlighted significant inaccuracies in the savings reported by DOGE. For instance, NPR found that while DOGE claimed $65 billion in savings, only about $2.3 billion was verified. This suggests a pattern of overstatement and errors in DOGE's reported figures.\n\n2. **Expert Doubts**: Experts have expressed doubts about the accuracy of DOGE's savings figures. The Fortune article indicates that DOGE's claims have consistently included inaccuracies and inflated numbers, which casts doubt on the reliability of their reported savings per taxpayer.\n\n3. **Operational and Legal Challenges**: The Guardian reports operational chaos and legal challenges facing DOGE, which could further impact its ability to achieve and report accurate savings. This includes federal judges questioning the legality of DOGE's structure and Musk's role.\n\n4. **Potential Overstatement**: There is evidence of potential overstatement in the valuation of canceled contracts, such as a contract listed as $8 billion actually being valued at $8 million. This suggests that the reported savings figures may not be trustworthy.\n\nGiven these factors, it seems unlikely that the DOGE Live Tracker will accurately report Savings Per Taxpayer within the specified range on March 31, 2025. The consistent pattern of inaccuracies and expert skepticism reduces confidence in DOGE's ability to meet the stated criteria.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.2",

He said anyone who questions DOGE's savings can look at the digital receipts for themselves.\n\n\"We won't be perfect,\" he said, \"but when we make mistakes, we'll fix it very quickly.\"\n\nThe latest inaccurate data identified by NPR remained on the DOGE site, as of Friday morning.\n\nThe White House has not responded to multiple requests over the last two weeks to explain the DOGE savings process, why changes have been made to the data, or if they are concerned about an official government data source sharing inaccurate information.\n\n**The new numbers**\n\nDOGE's [savings page](http://doge.gov/savings) launched with a topline claim of $55 billion saved, with \"receipts\" that accounted for about $16.5 billion in contract cancellations. But an [NPR review](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5302705/doge-overstates-savings-federal-contracts) found the documented savings were grossly overstated, including with an apparent $8 billion typo, the misleading inclusion of procurement methods that act as lines of credit and billions of dollars in contracts that were not actually terminated. By matching DOGE's claims with federal contract data, that NPR analysis found estimated savings of only about $2 billion — a fraction of what the receipts claimed or the higher, unverifiable claim of $55 billion overall.\n\nIn Tuesday's update, DOGE's new grand total is $65 billion saved. It's unclear how that tally was achieved. The site added almost 1,200 new \"receipts\" that claim to show another $4 billion in savings. But when NPR matched the claim…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 369 words out of ~1379. Full content available via `btf_extract_evidence`.]"

The [news agency](https://apnews.com/article/doge-federal-contracts-canceled-musk-trump-cuts-a65976a725412934ad686389889db0df) found that of those, 417 were likely to produce no savings to the federal budget.\n\nThe shredded contracts had been flaunted by Doge on its “wall of receipts”. Yet in many cases the money had already been spent, or had been legally committed to the extent that it was too late to recoup the funds.\n\n“It’s like confiscating used ammunition after it’s been shot when there’s nothing left in it,” Charles Tiefer, an expert on government contracting law, told the AP.\n\nThe review is just the latest investigation suggesting that Musk’s stampede through federal departments in an attempt supposedly to uncover fraud and reduce waste is not having the benefits claimed for it. One of the cancelled contracts was listed on the “wall of receipts” as being worth $8bn, when in fact the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/upshot/doge-contracts-musk-trump.html) discovered it was valued at $8m.\n\nMusk’s latest ruse, demanding that more than 2 million federal employees all email Doge a list of their five weekly accomplishments or face dismissal, has caused mayhem across the US government. Several Trump-picked heads of department have openly [resisted the move](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/24/elon-musk-federal-workers-chaos).\n\nKash Patel, Trump’s choice to be director of the FBI, instructed all employees at the bureau to “paus…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 331 words out of ~508.

He said anyone who questions DOGE's savings can look at the digital receipts for themselves.\n\n\"We won't be perfect,\" he said, \"but when we make mistakes, we'll fix it very quickly.\"\n\nThe latest inaccurate data identified by NPR remained on the DOGE site, as of Friday morning.\n\nThe White House has not responded to multiple requests over the last two weeks to explain the DOGE savings process, why changes have been made to the data, or if they are concerned about an official government data source sharing inaccurate information.\n\n**The new numbers**\n\nDOGE's [savings page](http://doge.gov/savings) launched with a topline claim of $55 billion saved, with \"receipts\" that accounted for about $16.5 billion in contract cancellations. But an [NPR review](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5302705/doge-overstates-savings-federal-contracts) found the documented savings were grossly overstated, including with an apparent $8 billion typo, the misleading inclusion of procurement methods that act as lines of credit and billions of dollars in contracts that were not actually terminated. By matching DOGE's claims with federal contract data, that NPR analysis found estimated savings of only about $2 billion — a fraction of what the receipts claimed or the higher, unverifiable claim of $55 billion overall.\n\nIn Tuesday's update, DOGE's new grand total is $65 billion saved. It's unclear how that tally was achieved. The site added almost 1,200 new \"receipts\" that claim to show another $4 billion in savings. But when NPR matched the claim…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 369 words out of ~1379. Full content available via `btf_extract_evidence`.]",

For instance, NPR found that while DOGE claimed $65 billion in savings, only about $2.3 billion was verified. This suggests a pattern of overstatement and errors in DOGE's reported figures.\n\n2. **Expert Doubts**: Experts have expressed doubts about the accuracy of DOGE's savings figures. The Fortune article indicates that DOGE's claims have consistently included inaccuracies and inflated numbers, which casts doubt on the reliability of their reported savings per taxpayer.\n\n3. **Operational and Legal Challenges**: The Guardian reports operational chaos and legal challenges facing DOGE, which could further impact its ability to achieve and report accurate savings. This includes federal judges questioning the legality of DOGE's structure and Musk's role.\n\n4. **Potential Overstatement**: There is evidence of potential overstatement in the valuation of canceled contracts, such as a contract listed as $8 billion actually being valued at $8 million. This suggests that the reported savings figures may not be trustworthy.\n\nGiven these factors, it seems unlikely that the DOGE Live Tracker will accurately report Savings Per Taxpayer within the specified range on March 31, 2025. The consistent pattern of inaccuracies and expert skepticism reduces confidence in DOGE's ability to meet the stated criteria.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.2"
