  "question": "Will Trump Media & Technology Group (the owner of Truth Social) stock continuously remain below its all-time high until March 31, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.95,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here's the analysis:\n\n1. **Current Stock Price**: As of March 4, 2025, the closing price of Trump Media & Technology Group stock was $22.27, which is significantly below the all-time high of $79.38. The stock has not reached or exceeded this all-time high since March 26, 2024.\n\n2. **Historical Performance**: The stock has shown a downward trend from a high of $69.70 on March 28, 2024, to $22.27 on March 4, 2025. Recent trading data from February and March 2025 shows the stock consistently trading below $32.\n\n3. **Market Trends and Forecasts**: Despite some positive news regarding new business initiatives like the launch of ETFs and expansion into financial services, the technical analysis indicates a strong sell signal with 12 indicators suggesting sell and only 4 suggesting buy. The moving averages also indicate a bearish trend.\n\n4. **Analyst Predictions**: Although there is a speculative forecast suggesting a potential increase to an average price of $193.25, this is highly speculative and not supported by current technical indicators.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the current price, historical performance, and technical analysis, it is highly probable that the stock will remain below its all-time high of $79.38 until March 31, 2025.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.95",

The stock has not reached or exceeded this all-time high since March 26, 2024.\n\n2. **Historical Performance**: The stock has shown a downward trend from a high of $69.70 on March 28, 2024, to $22.27 on March 4, 2025. Recent trading data from February and March 2025 shows the stock consistently trading below $32.\n\n3. **Market Trends and Forecasts**: Despite some positive news regarding new business initiatives like the launch of ETFs and expansion into financial services, the technical analysis indicates a strong sell signal with 12 indicators suggesting sell and only 4 suggesting buy. The moving averages also indicate a bearish trend.\n\n4. **Analyst Predictions**: Although there is a speculative forecast suggesting a potential increase to an average price of $193.25, this is highly speculative and not supported by current technical indicators.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the current price, historical performance, and technical analysis, it is highly probable that the stock will remain below its all-time high of $79.38 until March 31, 2025.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.95"
