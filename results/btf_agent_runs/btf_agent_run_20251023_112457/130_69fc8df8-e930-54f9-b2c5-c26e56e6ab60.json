  "question": "Will Texas have 15.0 million or more residents living in drought on March 28, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.65,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here is the analysis for the probability that Texas will have 15.0 million or more residents living in drought on March 28, 2025:\n\n1. **Current Drought Conditions**: As of late February 2025, severe or worse drought covers almost 25% of Texas, which is the largest extent since late October 2024. Currently, 43% of Texas is experiencing drought conditions, up from 42% a week ago and 23% a year ago.\n\n2. **Forecast and Predictions**: The seasonal drought outlook anticipates drought expansion to cover two-thirds of Texas by the end of May 2025. The National Weather Service's outlook is trending more pessimistic for Texas, with expectations of drought expansion sufficient to cover two-thirds of the state. La Niña conditions, which typically lead to drier weather patterns in Texas, are expected to continue, with a strong tilt towards below-average precipitation for the south-central High Plains and western Texas.\n\n3. **Regional Impact**: The eastern third of Texas is expected to remain drought-free, suggesting that the rest of the state may experience worsening drought conditions. The western half of Texas is particularly expected to see continued drought expansion due to below-average precipitation forecasts.\n\n4. **Historical Context and Current Measures**: Governor Greg Abbott has issued Drought Disaster Proclamations, indicating significant drought conditions. Public water systems in Texas are implementing drought contingency plans, highlighting concerns over water scarcity.\n\nGiven the current extent of drought, the forecasted expansion, and the historical context, it seems likely that a significant portion of Texas will continue to experience drought conditions. However, whether this will affect 15.0 million or more residents depends on the specific areas affected and their population density.\n\nConsidering the evidence, it is reasonable to estimate a moderate probability that the drought conditions will affect 15.0 million or more residents by the resolution date.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.65",

The largest expansion of drought occurred across the southern half of California and the Four Corners states, where subnormal precipitation combined with generally above-average temperatures. Drought also expanded across the Pacific Northwest and the Southeast. In contrast, widespread heavy precipitation fell across northern California and climatologically drier regions of Oregon, the Intermountain West, and the northern High Plains, sparking some drought reductions. An extreme precipitation event brought widespread flooding to Kentucky and portions of the central Appalachians, while also sparking some drought relief across the higher elevations of the mid-Atlantic. Across the remainder of the mid-Atlantic and Northeast, an unusually long term drought continues.\n\n\nThe seasonal drought outlook for March - May 2025 is based on an anticipated continuation of La Ni�a conditions and official temperature and precipitation forecast guidance at multiple time scales. A wetter pattern is favored to develop across the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies, which should be sufficient to alleviate drought conditions that have recently developed. A wetter pattern favored at the seasonal time scale also favors some drought reductions across the Great Lakes region, but persistence is more likely a…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 363 words out of ~599.

The largest expansion of drought occurred across the southern half of California and the Four Corners states, where subnormal precipitation combined with generally above-average temperatures. Drought also expanded across the Pacific Northwest and the Southeast. In contrast, widespread heavy precipitation fell across northern California and climatologically drier regions of Oregon, the Intermountain West, and the northern High Plains, sparking some drought reductions. An extreme precipitation event brought widespread flooding to Kentucky and portions of the central Appalachians, while also sparking some drought relief across the higher elevations of the mid-Atlantic. Across the remainder of the mid-Atlantic and Northeast, an unusually long term drought continues.\\n\\n\\nThe seasonal drought outlook for March - May 2025 is based on an anticipated continuation of La Ni\\ufffda conditions and official temperature and precipitation forecast guidance at multiple time scales. A wetter pattern is favored to develop across the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies, which should be sufficient to alleviate drought conditions that have recently developed.

      "content": "Based on the gathered evidence, here is the analysis for the probability that Texas will have 15.0 million or more residents living in drought on March 28, 2025:\n\n1. **Current Drought Conditions**: As of late February 2025, severe or worse drought covers almost 25% of Texas, which is the largest extent since late October 2024. Currently, 43% of Texas is experiencing drought conditions, up from 42% a week ago and 23% a year ago.\n\n2. **Forecast and Predictions**: The seasonal drought outlook anticipates drought expansion to cover two-thirds of Texas by the end of May 2025. The National Weather Service's outlook is trending more pessimistic for Texas, with expectations of drought expansion sufficient to cover two-thirds of the state. La Niña conditions, which typically lead to drier weather patterns in Texas, are expected to continue, with a strong tilt towards below-average precipitation for the south-central High Plains and western Texas.\n\n3. **Regional Impact**: The eastern third of Texas is expected to remain drought-free, suggesting that the rest of the state may experience worsening drought conditions. The western half of Texas is particularly expected to see continued drought expansion due to below-average precipitation forecasts.\n\n4. **Historical Context and Current Measures**: Governor Greg Abbott has issued Drought Disaster Proclamations, indicating significant drought conditions. Public water systems in Texas are implementing drought contingency plans, highlighting concerns over water scarcity.\n\nGiven the current extent of drought, the forecasted expansion, and the historical context, it seems likely that a significant portion of Texas will continue to experience drought conditions. However, whether this will affect 15.0 million or more residents depends on the specific areas affected and their population density.\n\nConsidering the evidence, it is reasonable to estimate a moderate probability that the drought conditions will affect 15.0 million or more residents by the resolution date.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.65"
