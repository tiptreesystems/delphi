  "question": "Will Donald Trump's net worth, according to Forbes, be greater than or equal to $8 billion and less than or equal to $10 billion (≥$8 billion and ≤$10 billion) on March 31, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.1,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered information, here are the key points regarding Donald Trump's net worth:\n\n1. **Forbes Estimates**: As of early March 2025, Forbes estimated Donald Trump's net worth at $4.6 billion. This is significantly below the $8 billion threshold required for a \"YES\" resolution.\n\n2. **Bloomberg Estimates**: Bloomberg estimated Trump's wealth at $7.08 billion in January 2025, which is still below the $8 billion mark.\n\n3. **Truth Social Stake**: Trump's most valuable asset, his stake in the parent company of Truth Social, has seen a decrease in value. It was valued at $3.5 billion as of November 2024, down from $6.3 billion.\n\n4. **Legal Liabilities**: Trump's legal liabilities are estimated at $570 million, which negatively impacts his net worth.\n\n5. **Real Estate and Other Assets**: His real estate investments and golf clubs are valued at $1.1 billion and $1 billion respectively as of August 2024.\n\n6. **Cryptocurrency Valuation**: Axios temporarily estimated Trump's net worth to be $58 billion after the launch of his cryptocurrency, $Trump, but this appears to be an outlier and not reflected in Forbes' or Bloomberg's estimates.\n\nGiven the current estimates from reputable sources like Forbes and Bloomberg, it seems unlikely that Trump's net worth will reach the $8 billion to $10 billion range by March 31, 2025.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1",

From Truth Social and real estate holdings to crypto, legal liabilities and cash — Forbes has the answer.\nsitename: Forbes\ndate: 2024-09-27\ncategories: ['Billionaires']\ntags: ['Definitive Net Worth,Donald Trump,Real Estate,Fortune,Rich,President,Trump,Net worth,Money,Wealth']\n---\n## W\n\n**hat’s Donald Trump really worth?**\n\nEveryone has an opinion, but *Forbes *has the answer: $5.6 billion, as of Nov. 4, one day before America heads to the polls. That’s $1.9 billion more than he was worth in 2016 and $3.1 billion more than in 2020. Rooted in real estate, the Trump fortune now depends on politics. His most valuable asset: a $3.5 billion stake in the publicly traded parent company to Truth Social, a right-wing Twitter knockoff that hemorrhages money and trades wildly. The value of that stake has fallen recently—from $6.3 billion last week, when Trump was worth an all-time high of $8.4 billion. But shares tend to surge when Trump’s campaign gets good news, meaning he could gain or lose billions on Election Day.\n\nBy Dan Alexander, Forbes Staff\n\nDan Alexander\n\n### 📱🌟\n\n## Truth Social’s Parent Company: **$3.5 billion**\n\nFORBES ESTIMATE AS OF NOVEMBER 4, 2024\n\n## Trump Media and Technology Group\n\n#### Net Value: **$3.5B**\n\nFrom a financial standpoint, Trump’s social-media venture is one of the most absurd businesses in America, generating sales of just $3.4 million in the 12 months through June and recording a net loss of $380 million. Revenues are down nearly 10 percent over the previous year, even while Trump dominates most news cycles. Yet Trump-loving traders bid up shares to head-scratching prices, boosting the value of Trump’s majority stake. If someone other than the former president were behind the company, investors would probably peg it near zero.\n\n### 🌭 🏢🗽\n\n## Trump’s Real Estate Investments **$1.1 billion**\n\nFORBES ESTIMATE AS OF AUGUST 2024\n\n## 1290 Avenue of the Americas\n\n#### Total Value: **$1.7B**\n\n#### Debt: **$950M**\n\n#### Net value: **$208M**\n\n#### What Trump owns: **30% stake in office and retail**\n\nThe former president has a stake in the Manhattan skyscraper that is five blocks south and one block west of Trump Tower, but he has no control over the building.

And while he may not be in the same financial league as his most important supporter, Elon Musk, the president is indeed plenty wealthy.\n\nAccording to Forbes, President Trump was tied with six other people including Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings for the honor of being the 319th wealthiest person in the world in 2024. The path to the Forbes 400 has been long and winding for the 47th president, including pitfalls and reversals that nearly wiped out his fortune multiple times, as well as legal troubles that may have landed him in prison for the rest of his life had he not won the 2024 presidential election.\n\n## How did Trump amass his fortune?\n\nIn Trump's telling, he is a self-made man who built his fortune with a small loan from his father. But in \"every era of Mr. Trump's life, his finances were deeply intertwined with, and dependent on, his father's wealth,\" said [ The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-schemes-fred-trump.html); the outlet claims that his parents ultimately transferred nearly $1 billion to their children while paying almost nothing in taxes. \"Fred Trump was relentless and creative in finding ways to channel this wealth to his children,\" and much of his maneuvering was \"structured to sidestep gift and inheritance taxes using methods tax experts described to The Times as improper or possibly illegal.\"\n\n## Subscribe to The Week\n\nEscape your echo chamber.
