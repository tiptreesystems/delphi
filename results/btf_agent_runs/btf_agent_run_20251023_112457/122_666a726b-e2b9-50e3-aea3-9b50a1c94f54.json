  "question": "Will the state of Delaware's Division of Corporations list OpenAI as an \"Exempt\" entity on March 31, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.1,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered information, here is the analysis:\n\n1. **OpenAI's Transition to For-Profit**: OpenAI is reportedly transitioning from its current structure, which includes a non-profit controlling entity, to a more traditional for-profit model. This includes restructuring as a for-profit public benefit corporation (PBC). This shift is driven by the need to attract investors and provide them with a clearer exit strategy and financial returns.\n\n2. **Impact on Non-Profit Status**: The transition to a for-profit PBC means that OpenAI will no longer be controlled by a non-profit board, and it will be subject to corporate taxes, losing the benefits it enjoyed as a non-profit. This indicates a significant move away from the non-profit structure.\n\n3. **Delaware Exempt Status**: For an entity to be listed as \"Exempt\" in Delaware, it typically needs to be a non-profit organization or meet specific criteria for exemption. Given OpenAI's shift towards a for-profit model, it is unlikely that it will qualify as an \"Exempt\" entity under Delaware's criteria by March 31, 2025.\n\n4. **Current Corporate Structure**: OpenAI's current structure involves a partnership between its original non-profit and a capped profit arm. However, the planned restructuring involves transforming the for-profit entity into a PBC, which will operate independently of the non-profit's control.\n\nConsidering these points, it seems improbable that OpenAI will be listed as an \"Exempt\" entity by Delaware's Division of Corporations on March 31, 2025, due to its transition to a for-profit structure.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1",

The board accused Altman of [lying to and obstructing](https://mashable.com/article/open-ai-board-why-fired-sam-altman-helen-toner-podcast) the work of the non-profit board and OpenAI's safety measures, including omitting the nature of his ownership of the OpenAI startup fund.

The increasing capabilities of present day systems mean it’s more important than ever for OpenAI and other AI companies to share the principles, economic mechanisms, and governance models that are core to our respective missions and operations.\n\n## Overview\n\nWe founded the OpenAI Nonprofit in late 2015 with the goal of building safe and beneficial artificial general intelligence for the benefit of humanity. A project like this might previously have been the provenance of one or multiple governments—a humanity-scale endeavor pursuing broad benefit for humankind.\n\nSeeing no clear path in the public sector, and given the success of other ambitious projects in private industry (e.g., SpaceX, Cruise, and others), we decided to pursue this project through private means bound by strong commitments to the public good. We initially believed a 501(c)(3) would be the most effective vehicle to direct the development of safe and broadly beneficial AGI while remaining unencumbered by profit incentives. We committed to publishing our research and data in cases where we felt it was safe to do so and would benefit the public.\n\nWe always suspected that our project would be capital intensive, which is why we launched with the goal of $1 billion in donation commitments. Yet over the years, OpenAI’s Nonprofit received approximately $130.5 million in total donations, which funded the Nonprofit’s op…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 362 words out of ~1253.

It requires simultaneously advancing AI’s capability, safety, and positive impact in the world. In this post, we share the history of our current structure, why we think a change is necessary, and what specific change we are considering.\n\n## The past\n\nWe began in 2015 as a research lab with a vision that AGI might really happen, and we wanted to help it go as well as possible. In these early days, we thought that progress relied on key ideas produced by top researchers and that supercomputing clusters were less important.\n\nWe performed experiments ranging from [toolkits for game-playing AI](https://openai.com/index/universe/) to [robotics research](https://openai.com/index/ingredients-for-robotics-research/) and published papers. We had no products, no business, and no commercial revenue.\n\nOur [stated goal](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai/) was “advancing digital intelligence in the way most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return.” A non-profit structure seemed fitting, and we raised donations in various forms including cash ($137M, less than a third of which was from Elon) and compute credits and discounts ($1.8M from Amazon and $50M or more from each of Azure and Google Cloud).\n\nEventually, it became clear that the most [advanced AI](https://openai.com/index/openai-five/) would continuously use [more and more compute](https://openai.com/index/ai-…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 356 words out of ~1217.

A project like this might previously have been the provenance of one or multiple governments—a humanity-scale endeavor pursuing broad benefit for humankind.\n\nSeeing no clear path in the public sector, and given the success of other ambitious projects in private industry (e.g., SpaceX, Cruise, and others), we decided to pursue this project through private means bound by strong commitments to the public good. We initially believed a 501(c)(3) would be the most effective vehicle to direct the development of safe and broadly beneficial AGI while remaining unencumbered by profit incentives. We committed to publishing our research and data in cases where we felt it was safe to do so and would benefit the public.\n\nWe always suspected that our project would be capital intensive, which is why we launched with the goal of $1 billion in donation commitments.

It requires simultaneously advancing AI\\u2019s capability, safety, and positive impact in the world. In this post, we share the history of our current structure, why we think a change is necessary, and what specific change we are considering.\\n\\n## The past\\n\\nWe began in 2015 as a research lab with a vision that AGI might really happen, and we wanted to help it go as well as possible. In these early days, we thought that progress relied on key ideas produced by top researchers and that supercomputing clusters were less important.\\n\\nWe performed experiments ranging from [toolkits for game-playing AI](https://openai.com/index/universe/) to [robotics research](https://openai.com/index/ingredients-for-robotics-research/) and published papers. We had no products, no business, and no commercial revenue.\\n\\nOur [stated goal](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai/) was \\u201cadvancing digital intelligence in the way most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return.\\u201d A non-profit structure seemed fitting, and we raised donations in various forms including cash ($137M, less than a third of which was from Elon) and compute credits and discounts ($1.8M from Amazon and $50M or more from each of Azure and Google Cloud).\\n\\nEventually, it became clear that the most [advanced AI](https://openai.com/index/openai-five/) would continuously use [more and more compute](https://openai.com/index/ai-\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 356 words out of ~1217.

      "content": "Based on the gathered information, here is the analysis:\n\n1. **OpenAI's Transition to For-Profit**: OpenAI is reportedly transitioning from its current structure, which includes a non-profit controlling entity, to a more traditional for-profit model. This includes restructuring as a for-profit public benefit corporation (PBC). This shift is driven by the need to attract investors and provide them with a clearer exit strategy and financial returns.\n\n2. **Impact on Non-Profit Status**: The transition to a for-profit PBC means that OpenAI will no longer be controlled by a non-profit board, and it will be subject to corporate taxes, losing the benefits it enjoyed as a non-profit. This indicates a significant move away from the non-profit structure.\n\n3. **Delaware Exempt Status**: For an entity to be listed as \"Exempt\" in Delaware, it typically needs to be a non-profit organization or meet specific criteria for exemption. Given OpenAI's shift towards a for-profit model, it is unlikely that it will qualify as an \"Exempt\" entity under Delaware's criteria by March 31, 2025.\n\n4. **Current Corporate Structure**: OpenAI's current structure involves a partnership between its original non-profit and a capped profit arm. However, the planned restructuring involves transforming the for-profit entity into a PBC, which will operate independently of the non-profit's control.\n\nConsidering these points, it seems improbable that OpenAI will be listed as an \"Exempt\" entity by Delaware's Division of Corporations on March 31, 2025, due to its transition to a for-profit structure.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1"
