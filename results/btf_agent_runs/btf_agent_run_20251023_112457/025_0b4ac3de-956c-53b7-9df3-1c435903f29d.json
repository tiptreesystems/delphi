  "question": "Will the DC cherry trees reach peak bloom on or before March 27 in 2025?",
  "probability": 0.1,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here are the key points:\n\n1. The National Park Service and other sources have forecasted that the peak bloom for the DC cherry blossoms in 2025 is expected to occur between March 28 and 31. This forecast was made based on current weather conditions and historical data.\n\n2. As of March 24, 2025, the cherry blossoms have reached the \"Peduncle Elongation\" stage, and there have been cooler temperatures and persistent light rain, which are slowing down the blooming process.\n\n3. Historically, peak bloom has occurred as early as March 15 and as late as April 18, but the most common period is between the last week of March and the first week of April.\n\n4. The forecasted peak bloom dates (March 28-31) are after the resolution date of March 27, 2025, which means it is unlikely for the peak bloom to occur on or before March 27.\n\nGiven these points, the probability that the DC cherry trees will reach peak bloom on or before March 27, 2025, is low.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1",

Peak bloom varies annually depending on weather conditions. The most likely time to reach peak bloom is between the last week of March and the first week of April. Extraordinary warm or cool temperatures have resulted in peak bloom as early as March 15 (1990) and as late as April 18 (1958).\n\n\n**How long is peak bloom? **\n\nThe Yoshino trees typically bloom for a period of **several days**. The length of the blooming period depends on weather conditions. Cool, calm weather can extend the length of the bloom, and a rainy, windy day can bring an abrupt end to the ephemeral blossoms. A late frost can prevent the trees from blooming at all.\n\n\n**Predicting the bloom.**\n\nForecasting peak bloom is almost impossible more than **10 days in advance**. The cherry trees' blossom development is dependent on weather conditions. National Park Service horticulturists monitor bud development and report the status of the blossoms.\n\nYear |\nGreen Buds |\nFlorets Visible |\nExtension of Florets |\nPeduncle Elongation |\nPuffy White |\nPeak Bloom |\n| 2025 | Mar 11 |\nMar 16 |\nMar 19 |\nMar 20 |\n||\n| 2024 | Mar 2 | Mar 5 | Mar 8 | Mar 12 | Mar 15 | Mar 17 |\n| 2023 | Feb 23 | Mar 1 | Mar 7 | Mar 11 | Mar 18 | Mar 23 |\n| 2022 | Mar 3 | Mar 7 | Mar 14 | Mar 17 | Mar 19 | Mar 21 |\n| 2021 | Mar 11 | Mar 16 | Mar 22 | Mar 24 | Mar 26 | Mar 28 |\n| 2020 | Feb 28 | Mar 3 | Mar 9 | Mar 12 | Mar 16 | Mar 20 |\n| 2019 | Mar 5 | Mar 17 | Mar 23 | Mar 25 | Mar 29 | Apr 1 |\n| 2018 | Feb 25 | Mar 15 | Mar 26 | Mar 29 | Apr 1 | Apr 5 |\n| 2017 | Feb 24 | Mar 1 | Mar 6 | Mar 8 | Mar 22* | Mar 25* |\n| 2016 | Mar 8 | Mar 13 | Mar 15 | Mar 17 | Mar 22 | Mar 25 |\n| 2015 | Mar 18 | Apr 1 | Apr 4 | Apr 6 | Apr 8 | Apr 10 |\n| 2014 | Mar 16 | Ma…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 482 words out of ~848.

Peak bloom varies annually depending on weather conditions. The most likely time to reach peak bloom is between the last week of March and the first week of April. Extraordinary warm or cool temperatures have resulted in peak bloom as early as March 15 (1990) and as late as April 18 (1958).\n\n\n**How long is peak bloom? **\n\nThe Yoshino trees typically bloom for a period of **several days**. The length of the blooming period depends on weather conditions. Cool, calm weather can extend the length of the bloom, and a rainy, windy day can bring an abrupt end to the ephemeral blossoms. A late frost can prevent the trees from blooming at all.\n\n\n**Predicting the bloom.**\n\nForecasting peak bloom is almost impossible more than **10 days in advance**. The cherry trees' blossom development is dependent on weather conditions. National Park Service horticulturists monitor bud development and report the status of the blossoms.\n\nYear |\nGreen Buds |\nFlorets Visible |\nExtension of Florets |\nPeduncle Elongation |\nPuffy White |\nPeak Bloom |\n| 2025 | Mar 11 |\nMar 16 |\nMar 19 |\nMar 20 |\n||\n| 2024 | Mar 2 | Mar 5 | Mar 8 | Mar 12 | Mar 15 | Mar 17 |\n| 2023 | Feb 23 | Mar 1 | Mar 7 | Mar 11 | Mar 18 | Mar 23 |\n| 2022 | Mar 3 | Mar 7 | Mar 14 | Mar 17 | Mar 19 | Mar 21 |\n| 2021 | Mar 11 | Mar 16 | Mar 22 | Mar 24 | Mar 26 | Mar 28 |\n| 2020 | Feb 28 | Mar 3 | Mar 9 | Mar 12 | Mar 16 | Mar 20 |\n| 2019 | Mar 5 | Mar 17 | Mar 23 | Mar 25 | Mar 29 | Apr 1 |\n| 2018 | Feb 25 | Mar 15 | Mar 26 | Mar 29 | Apr 1 | Apr 5 |\n| 2017 | Feb 24 | Mar 1 | Mar 6 | Mar 8 | Mar 22* | Mar 25* |\n| 2016 | Mar 8 | Mar 13 | Mar 15 | Mar 17 | Mar 22 | Mar 25 |\n| 2015 | Mar 18 | Apr 1 | Apr 4 | Apr 6 | Apr 8 | Apr 10 |\n| 2014 | Mar 16 | Ma…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 482 words out of ~848.

Peak bloom varies annually depending on weather conditions. The most likely time to reach peak bloom is between the last week of March and the first week of April. Extraordinary warm or cool temperatures have resulted in peak bloom as early as March 15 (1990) and as late as April 18 (1958).\\n\\n\\n**How long is peak bloom? **\\n\\nThe Yoshino trees typically bloom for a period of **several days**. The length of the blooming period depends on weather conditions. Cool, calm weather can extend the length of the bloom, and a rainy, windy day can bring an abrupt end to the ephemeral blossoms. A late frost can prevent the trees from blooming at all.\\n\\n\\n**Predicting the bloom.**\\n\\nForecasting peak bloom is almost impossible more than **10 days in advance**. The cherry trees' blossom development is dependent on weather conditions. National Park Service horticulturists monitor bud development and report the status of the blossoms.\\n\\nYear |\\nGreen Buds |\\nFlorets Visible |\\nExtension of Florets |\\nPeduncle Elongation |\\nPuffy White |\\nPeak Bloom |\\n| 2025 | Mar 11 |\\nMar 16 |\\nMar 19 |\\nMar 20 |\\n||\\n| 2024 | Mar 2 | Mar 5 | Mar 8 | Mar 12 | Mar 15 | Mar 17 |\\n| 2023 | Feb 23 | Mar 1 | Mar 7 | Mar 11 | Mar 18 | Mar 23 |\\n| 2022 | Mar 3 | Mar 7 | Mar 14 | Mar 17 | Mar 19 | Mar 21 |\\n| 2021 | Mar 11 | Mar 16 | Mar 22 | Mar 24 | Mar 26 | Mar 28 |\\n| 2020 | Feb 28 | Mar 3 | Mar 9 | Mar 12 | Mar 16 | Mar 20 |\\n| 2019 | Mar 5 | Mar 17 | Mar 23 | Mar 25 | Mar 29 | Apr 1 |\\n| 2018 | Feb 25 | Mar 15 | Mar 26 | Mar 29 | Apr 1 | Apr 5 |\\n| 2017 | Feb 24 | Mar 1 | Mar 6 | Mar 8 | Mar 22* | Mar 25* |\\n| 2016 | Mar 8 | Mar 13 | Mar 15 | Mar 17 | Mar 22 | Mar 25 |\\n| 2015 | Mar 18 | Apr 1 | Apr 4 | Apr 6 | Apr 8 | Apr 10 |\\n| 2014 | Mar 16 | Ma\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 482 words out of ~848.

Peak bloom varies annually depending on weather conditions. The most likely time to reach peak bloom is between the last week of March and the first week of April. Extraordinary warm or cool temperatures have resulted in peak bloom as early as March 15 (1990) and as late as April 18 (1958).\\n\\n\\n**How long is peak bloom? **\\n\\nThe Yoshino trees typically bloom for a period of **several days**. The length of the blooming period depends on weather conditions. Cool, calm weather can extend the length of the bloom, and a rainy, windy day can bring an abrupt end to the ephemeral blossoms. A late frost can prevent the trees from blooming at all.\\n\\n\\n**Predicting the bloom.**\\n\\nForecasting peak bloom is almost impossible more than **10 days in advance**. The cherry trees' blossom development is dependent on weather conditions. National Park Service horticulturists monitor bud development and report the status of the blossoms.\\n\\nYear |\\nGreen Buds |\\nFlorets Visible |\\nExtension of Florets |\\nPeduncle Elongation |\\nPuffy White |\\nPeak Bloom |\\n| 2025 | Mar 11 |\\nMar 16 |\\nMar 19 |\\nMar 20 |\\n||\\n| 2024 | Mar 2 | Mar 5 | Mar 8 | Mar 12 | Mar 15 | Mar 17 |\\n| 2023 | Feb 23 | Mar 1 | Mar 7 | Mar 11 | Mar 18 | Mar 23 |\\n| 2022 | Mar 3 | Mar 7 | Mar 14 | Mar 17 | Mar 19 | Mar 21 |\\n| 2021 | Mar 11 | Mar 16 | Mar 22 | Mar 24 | Mar 26 | Mar 28 |\\n| 2020 | Feb 28 | Mar 3 | Mar 9 | Mar 12 | Mar 16 | Mar 20 |\\n| 2019 | Mar 5 | Mar 17 | Mar 23 | Mar 25 | Mar 29 | Apr 1 |\\n| 2018 | Feb 25 | Mar 15 | Mar 26 | Mar 29 | Apr 1 | Apr 5 |\\n| 2017 | Feb 24 | Mar 1 | Mar 6 | Mar 8 | Mar 22* | Mar 25* |\\n| 2016 | Mar 8 | Mar 13 | Mar 15 | Mar 17 | Mar 22 | Mar 25 |\\n| 2015 | Mar 18 | Apr 1 | Apr 4 | Apr 6 | Apr 8 | Apr 10 |\\n| 2014 | Mar 16 | Ma\\u0014\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 482 words out of ~848.

The National Park Service and other sources have forecasted that the peak bloom for the DC cherry blossoms in 2025 is expected to occur between March 28 and 31. This forecast was made based on current weather conditions and historical data.\n\n2. As of March 24, 2025, the cherry blossoms have reached the \"Peduncle Elongation\" stage, and there have been cooler temperatures and persistent light rain, which are slowing down the blooming process.\n\n3. Historically, peak bloom has occurred as early as March 15 and as late as April 18, but the most common period is between the last week of March and the first week of April.\n\n4. The forecasted peak bloom dates (March 28-31) are after the resolution date of March 27, 2025, which means it is unlikely for the peak bloom to occur on or before March 27.\n\nGiven these points, the probability that the DC cherry trees will reach peak bloom on or before March 27, 2025, is low.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1"
