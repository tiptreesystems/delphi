  "question": "Before April 1, 2025, will Perplexity announce that it is planning an IPO?",
  "probability": 0.1,
  "reasoning": "Based on the search results, there is no indication that Perplexity AI has announced plans for an IPO as of March 17, 2025. The articles and snippets retrieved suggest that Perplexity AI has not made any public announcements regarding an IPO, and there are no reports of such plans. Additionally, the company seems to be focusing on raising private investments and expanding its business model without going public.\n\nGiven the lack of evidence for an impending IPO announcement and the focus on private funding, the probability that Perplexity AI will announce an IPO before April 1, 2025, appears low.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1",
