  "probability": 0.6,
  "reasoning": "Based on the search results:\n\n1. **Sam Altman's Net Worth**: As of February 2025, Sam Altman's net worth was estimated at $1.2 billion according to Wikipedia. This is an increase from the $1.1 billion reported in December 2024.\n\n2. **OpenAI Valuation**: OpenAI had a valuation of $157 billion as of October 2024. This indicates a strong financial position for the company, which could positively impact Altman's net worth if he holds indirect stakes through other investments.\n\n3. **Recent Investments**: Sam Altman has been actively investing in various sectors, including AI, biotech, energy, and more. His recent investment was in Roboflow in August 2024. His diverse investment portfolio could contribute to an increase in his net worth.\n\n### Analysis\n\n- **Net Worth Growth**: Altman's net worth increased by $0.1 billion from December 2024 to February 2025. If this growth continues, it is possible that his net worth could reach or exceed $1.4 billion by March 31, 2025.\n  \n- **OpenAI's Performance**: The high valuation of OpenAI suggests that Altman's indirect stakes could be valuable, potentially increasing his net worth further.\n\n- **Investment Portfolio**: Altman's wide-ranging investments might yield significant returns, contributing to his net worth growth.\n\nGiven the current trajectory and the potential for further financial gains through his investments and OpenAI's performance, there is a reasonable chance that Sam Altman's net worth could exceed $1.3 billion by the specified date.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.6",
