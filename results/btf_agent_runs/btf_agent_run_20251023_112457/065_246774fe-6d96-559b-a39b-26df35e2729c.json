  "question": "Will the number of active US drilling rigs be 575 to 579 on March 28, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.15,
  "reasoning": "Based on the information gathered:\n\n1. **Current Rig Count**: As of March 14, 2025, the U.S. rig count was 592, with no change from the previous week. This indicates stability in the number of active rigs, which is above the target range of 575 to 579.\n\n2. **Policy and Market Influences**: \n   - The U.S. government, under President Trump, is pushing for increased drilling through deregulation and executive orders. However, these efforts face legal challenges and market forces such as low oil prices, which may deter significant expansion in drilling operations.\n   - Oil prices have declined significantly, with Brent futures trading near three-year lows around $70/bbl. This price level is below the $89/barrel threshold identified as necessary for substantial increases in drilling.\n\n3. **Global Supply and Demand**: \n   - Global oil supply is increasing, with OPEC+ planning to unwind production cuts, potentially adding to the supply and putting further downward pressure on prices.\n   - The U.S. is producing at record highs and is expected to be a major source of supply growth in 2025, suggesting continued drilling activity, albeit potentially at a stable or slightly reduced rate due to market conditions.\n\nGiven the current rig count is stable at 592 and the market conditions suggest limited incentives for increasing drilling, the probability of the rig count dropping into the 575-579 range by March 28, 2025, seems low. However, the possibility of a slight reduction due to market adjustments or strategic decisions by drilling companies cannot be entirely ruled out.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.15",

Additionally, Doug Bergum, Trump's nominee for Secretary of the Interior, [has promised](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/dec/01/doug-burgum-trump-interior-secretary-drilling) to open up federally-protected lands to expedited oil and gas drilling permits.\n\nHowever, OilPrice.com [reports](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Exxon-Pours-Cold-Water-On-Trumps-Drill-Baby-Drill-Plans.html) that it might not be this simple, quoting Exxon’s Upstream President Liam Mallon  and TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanne as saying it is more likely that oil producers, due to a looming surplus of oil in 2025 combined with a need to maximize shareholder returns on capital, may throttle new production in order to avoid price destruction.\n\nAccording to the Financial Times ([‘Drill, baby, drill’ is not so simple](https://www.ft.com/content/90468253-0560-4cb2-a302-2e8636234265)), a key factor will be oil prices. A Kansas City Fed survey of energy firms found that a price of \\$89/barrel was needed for drilling to substantially increase, while oil prices as of January 2025 have been on a downswing:\n\n![Price history](https://metaculus-web-media.s3.amazonaws.com/user_uploaded/Screenshot_2024-12-05_at_2.40.51%C3%A2PM.png)\n\nAccording to Baker Hughes in its recent [annual report](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1701605/000170160524000033/bkr-20231231.htm):\n\n> The Baker Hughes rig counts are an important business barometer for the drilling industry and its suppliers. When drilling rigs are active they consume products and services produced by the oil service industry. Rig count trends are driven by the exploration and development spending by oil and natural gas companies, which in turn is influenced by current and future price expectations for oil and natural gas. The counts may reflect the relative strength and stability of energy prices and overall market activity; however, these counts should not be solely relied on as other specific and pervasive conditions may exist that affect overall energy prices and market activity.\n\n> We have been providing rig counts to the public since 1944. We gather all relevant data through our field service personnel, who obtain the necessary data from routine visits to the various rigs, customers, contractors and other outside sources as necessary. We base the classification of a well as either oil or natural gas primarily upon filings made by operators in the relevant jurisdiction. This data is then compiled and distributed to various wire services and trade associations and is published on our website. We believe the counting process and resulting data is reliable; however, it is subject to our ability to obtain accurate and timely information. Rig counts are compiled weekly for the U.S. and Canada and monthly for all international rigs. Published international rig counts do not include rigs drilling in certain locations, such as onshore China because this information is not readily available.\n\n> Rigs in the U.S. and Canada are counted as active if, on the day the count is taken, the well being drilled has been started but drilling has not been completed and the well is anticipated to be of sufficient depth to be a potential consumer of our drill bits. In international areas, rigs are counted on a weekly basis and deemed active if drilling activities occurred during the majority of the week. The weekly results are then averaged for the month and published accordingly. The rig count does not include rigs that are in transit from one location to another, rigging up, being used in non-drilling activities including production testing, completion and workover, and are not expected to be significant consumers of drill bits.\n\nAccording to the rig count [FAQ](https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/rig-count-faqs), data is published each Friday at noon central US time. Recent reports have found the following rig count numbers:\n\n| Date               | Value | Date              | Value |\n| ------------------ | ----- | ----------------- | ----- |\n| January 31, 2025   | 582   | July 5, 2024      | 585   |\n| January 24, 2025   | 576   | June 28, 2024     | 581   |\n| January 17, 2025   | 580   | June 21, 2024     | 588   |\n| January 10, 2025   | 584   | June 14, 2024     | 590   |\n| January 3, 2025    | 589   | June 7, 2024      | 594   |\n| December 27, 2024  | 589   | May 31, 2024      | 600   |\n| December 20, 2024  | 589   | May 24, 2024      | 600   |\n| December 13, 2024  | 589   | May 17, 2024      | 604   |\n| December 6, 2024   | 589   | May 10, 2024      | 603   |\n| November 27, 2024  | 582   | May 3, 2024       | 605   |\n| November 22, 2024  | 583   | April 26, 2024    | 613   |\n| November 15, 2024  | 584   | April 19, 2024    | 619   |\n| November 8, 2024   | 585   | April 12, 2024    | 617   |\n| November 1, 2024   | 585   | April 5, 2024     | 620   |\n| October 25, 2024   | 585   | March 28, 2024    | 621   |\n| October 18, 2024   | 585   | March 22, 2024    | 624   |\n| October 11, 2024   | 586   | March 15, 2024    | 629   |\n| October 4, 2024    | 585   | March 8, 2024     | 622   |\n| September 27, 2024 | 587   | March 1, 2024     | 629   |\n| September 20, 2024 | 588   | February 23, 2024 | 626   |\n| September 13, 2024 | 590   | February 16, 2024 | 621   |\n| September 6, 2024  | 582   | February 9, 2024  | 623   |\n| August 30, 2024    | 583   | February 2, 2024  | 619   |\n| August 23, 2024    | 585   | January 26, 2024  | 621   |\n| August 16, 2024    | 586   | January 19, 2024  | 620   |\n| August 9, 2024     | 588   | January 12, 2024  | 619   |\n| August 2, 2024     | 586   | January 5, 2024   | 621   |\n| July 26, 2024      | 589   | December 29, 2023 | 622   |\n| July 19, 2024      | 586   | December 21, 2023 | 620   |\n| July 12, 2024      | 584   |                   |       |\nResolution criteria: This question resolves as YES if the last count of active US drilling rigs for the week ending March 28, 2025, according to the Baker Hughes North America Rig Count, is between 575 and 579 inclusive.

Additionally, Doug Bergum, Trump's nominee for Secretary of the Interior, has promised to open up federally-protected lands to expedited oil and gas drilling permits. However, OilPrice.com reports that it might not be this simple, quoting Exxon’s Upstream President Liam Mallon and TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanne as saying it is more likely that oil producers, due to a looming surplus of oil in 2025 combined with a need to maximize shareholder returns on capital, may throttle new production in order to avoid price destruction. According to the Financial Times, a key factor will be oil prices. A Kansas City Fed survey of energy firms found that a price of $89/barrel was needed for drilling to substantially increase, while oil prices as of January 2025 have been on a downswing.\", \"resolution_criteria\": \"This question resolves as YES if the last count of active US drilling rigs for the week ending March 28, 2025, according to the Baker Hughes North America Rig Count, is between 575 and 579 inclusive.\", \"present_date\": \"2025-03-19T18:44:43.714349\", \"date_cutoff_start\": \"2025-03-01\", \"date_cutoff_end\": \"2025-03-19\", \"max_facts\": 5}"

      "content": "Based on the information gathered:\n\n1. **Current Rig Count**: As of March 14, 2025, the U.S. rig count was 592, with no change from the previous week. This indicates stability in the number of active rigs, which is above the target range of 575 to 579.\n\n2. **Policy and Market Influences**: \n   - The U.S. government, under President Trump, is pushing for increased drilling through deregulation and executive orders. However, these efforts face legal challenges and market forces such as low oil prices, which may deter significant expansion in drilling operations.\n   - Oil prices have declined significantly, with Brent futures trading near three-year lows around $70/bbl. This price level is below the $89/barrel threshold identified as necessary for substantial increases in drilling.\n\n3. **Global Supply and Demand**: \n   - Global oil supply is increasing, with OPEC+ planning to unwind production cuts, potentially adding to the supply and putting further downward pressure on prices.\n   - The U.S. is producing at record highs and is expected to be a major source of supply growth in 2025, suggesting continued drilling activity, albeit potentially at a stable or slightly reduced rate due to market conditions.\n\nGiven the current rig count is stable at 592 and the market conditions suggest limited incentives for increasing drilling, the probability of the rig count dropping into the 575-579 range by March 28, 2025, seems low. However, the possibility of a slight reduction due to market adjustments or strategic decisions by drilling companies cannot be entirely ruled out.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.15"
