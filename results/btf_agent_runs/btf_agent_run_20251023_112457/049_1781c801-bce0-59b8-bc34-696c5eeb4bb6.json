  "question": "Will the DC cherry trees reach peak bloom on March 31 in 2025?",
  "probability": 0.7,
  "reasoning": "Based on the information gathered:\n\n1. **Peak Bloom Prediction**: The National Park Service has predicted that the peak bloom for the cherry blossoms in 2025 will occur between March 28 and March 31. This prediction is based on historical data and current bud development.\n\n2. **Weather Conditions**: The weather forecast for Washington, D.C., towards the end of March 2025 indicates temperatures ranging from 68°F to 73°F with no extreme weather conditions expected. This suggests favorable conditions for the cherry blossoms to reach peak bloom within the predicted window.\n\n3. **Current Blossom Development**: As of March 24, 2025, cooler temperatures have slowed the development slightly, but the blossoms are still on track for the predicted peak bloom dates.\n\nConsidering these factors, there is a high probability that the cherry trees will reach peak bloom on March 31, 2025, as it falls within the predicted window and the weather conditions are conducive to blooming.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.7",

Peak bloom varies annually depending on weather conditions. The most likely time to reach peak bloom is between the last week of March and the first week of April. Extraordinary warm or cool temperatures have resulted in peak bloom as early as March 15 (1990) and as late as April 18 (1958).\n\n\n**How long is peak bloom? **\n\nThe Yoshino trees typically bloom for a period of **several days**. The length of the blooming period depends on weather conditions. Cool, calm weather can extend the length of the bloom, and a rainy, windy day can bring an abrupt end to the ephemeral blossoms. A late frost can prevent the trees from blooming at all.\n\n\n**Predicting the bloom.**\n\nForecasting peak bloom is almost impossible more than **10 days in advance**. The cherry trees' blossom development is dependent on weather conditions. National Park Service horticulturists monitor bud development and report the status of the blossoms.\n\nYear |\nGreen Buds |\nFlorets Visible |\nExtension of Florets |\nPeduncle Elongation |\nPuffy White |\nPeak Bloom |\n| 2025 | Mar 11 |\nMar 16 |\nMar 19 |\nMar 20 |\n||\n| 2024 | Mar 2 | Mar 5 | Mar 8 | Mar 12 | Mar 15 | Mar 17 |\n| 2023 | Feb 23 | Mar 1 | Mar 7 | Mar 11 | Mar 18 | Mar 23 |\n| 2022 | Mar 3 | Mar 7 | Mar 14 | Mar 17 | Mar 19 | Mar 21 |\n| 2021 | Mar 11 | Mar 16 | Mar 22 | Mar 24 | Mar 26 | Mar 28 |\n| 2020 | Feb 28 | Mar 3 | Mar 9 | Mar 12 | Mar 16 | Mar 20 |\n| 2019 | Mar 5 | Mar 17 | Mar 23 | Mar 25 | Mar 29 | Apr 1 |\n| 2018 | Feb 25 | Mar 15 | Mar 26 | Mar 29 | Apr 1 | Apr 5 |\n| 2017 | Feb 24 | Mar 1 | Mar 6 | Mar 8 | Mar 22* | Mar 25* |\n| 2016 | Mar 8 | Mar 13 | Mar 15 | Mar 17 | Mar 22 | Mar 25 |\n| 2015 | Mar 18 | Apr 1 | Apr 4 | Apr 6 | Apr 8 | Apr 10 |\n| 2014 | Mar 16 | Ma…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 482 words out of ~848.

Peak bloom varies annually depending on weather conditions. The most likely time to reach peak bloom is between the last week of March and the first week of April. Extraordinary warm or cool temperatures have resulted in peak bloom as early as March 15 (1990) and as late as April 18 (1958).\n\n\n**How long is peak bloom? **\n\nThe Yoshino trees typically bloom for a period of **several days**. The length of the blooming period depends on weather conditions. Cool, calm weather can extend the length of the bloom, and a rainy, windy day can bring an abrupt end to the ephemeral blossoms. A late frost can prevent the trees from blooming at all.\n\n\n**Predicting the bloom.**\n\nForecasting peak bloom is almost impossible more than **10 days in advance**. The cherry trees' blossom development is dependent on weather conditions. National Park Service horticulturists monitor bud development and report the status of the blossoms.\n\nYear |\nGreen Buds |\nFlorets Visible |\nExtension of Florets |\nPeduncle Elongation |\nPuffy White |\nPeak Bloom |\n| 2025 | Mar 11 |\nMar 16 |\nMar 19 |\nMar 20 |\n||\n| 2024 | Mar 2 | Mar 5 | Mar 8 | Mar 12 | Mar 15 | Mar 17 |\n| 2023 | Feb 23 | Mar 1 | Mar 7 | Mar 11 | Mar 18 | Mar 23 |\n| 2022 | Mar 3 | Mar 7 | Mar 14 | Mar 17 | Mar 19 | Mar 21 |\n| 2021 | Mar 11 | Mar 16 | Mar 22 | Mar 24 | Mar 26 | Mar 28 |\n| 2020 | Feb 28 | Mar 3 | Mar 9 | Mar 12 | Mar 16 | Mar 20 |\n| 2019 | Mar 5 | Mar 17 | Mar 23 | Mar 25 | Mar 29 | Apr 1 |\n| 2018 | Feb 25 | Mar 15 | Mar 26 | Mar 29 | Apr 1 | Apr 5 |\n| 2017 | Feb 24 | Mar 1 | Mar 6 | Mar 8 | Mar 22* | Mar 25* |\n| 2016 | Mar 8 | Mar 13 | Mar 15 | Mar 17 | Mar 22 | Mar 25 |\n| 2015 | Mar 18 | Apr 1 | Apr 4 | Apr 6 | Apr 8 | Apr 10 |\n| 2014 | Mar 16 | Ma…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 482 words out of ~848.

Peak bloom varies annually depending on weather conditions. The most likely time to reach peak bloom is between the last week of March and the first week of April. Extraordinary warm or cool temperatures have resulted in peak bloom as early as March 15 (1990) and as late as April 18 (1958).\\n\\n\\n**How long is peak bloom? **\\n\\nThe Yoshino trees typically bloom for a period of **several days**. The length of the blooming period depends on weather conditions. Cool, calm weather can extend the length of the bloom, and a rainy, windy day can bring an abrupt end to the ephemeral blossoms. A late frost can prevent the trees from blooming at all.\\n\\n\\n**Predicting the bloom.**\\n\\nForecasting peak bloom is almost impossible more than **10 days in advance**. The cherry trees' blossom development is dependent on weather conditions. National Park Service horticulturists monitor bud development and report the status of the blossoms.\\n\\nYear |\\nGreen Buds |\\nFlorets Visible |\\nExtension of Florets |\\nPeduncle Elongation |\\nPuffy White |\\nPeak Bloom |\\n| 2025 | Mar 11 |\\nMar 16 |\\nMar 19 |\\nMar 20 |\\n||\\n| 2024 | Mar 2 | Mar 5 | Mar 8 | Mar 12 | Mar 15 | Mar 17 |\\n| 2023 | Feb 23 | Mar 1 | Mar 7 | Mar 11 | Mar 18 | Mar 23 |\\n| 2022 | Mar 3 | Mar 7 | Mar 14 | Mar 17 | Mar 19 | Mar 21 |\\n| 2021 | Mar 11 | Mar 16 | Mar 22 | Mar 24 | Mar 26 | Mar 28 |\\n| 2020 | Feb 28 | Mar 3 | Mar 9 | Mar 12 | Mar 16 | Mar 20 |\\n| 2019 | Mar 5 | Mar 17 | Mar 23 | Mar 25 | Mar 29 | Apr 1 |\\n| 2018 | Feb 25 | Mar 15 | Mar 26 | Mar 29 | Apr 1 | Apr 5 |\\n| 2017 | Feb 24 | Mar 1 | Mar 6 | Mar 8 | Mar 22* | Mar 25* |\\n| 2016 | Mar 8 | Mar 13 | Mar 15 | Mar 17 | Mar 22 | Mar 25 |\\n| 2015 | Mar 18 | Apr 1 | Apr 4 | Apr 6 | Apr 8 | Apr 10 |\\n| 2014 | Mar 16 | Ma\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 482 words out of ~848.

      "content": "Based on the information gathered:\n\n1. **Peak Bloom Prediction**: The National Park Service has predicted that the peak bloom for the cherry blossoms in 2025 will occur between March 28 and March 31. This prediction is based on historical data and current bud development.\n\n2. **Weather Conditions**: The weather forecast for Washington, D.C., towards the end of March 2025 indicates temperatures ranging from 68°F to 73°F with no extreme weather conditions expected. This suggests favorable conditions for the cherry blossoms to reach peak bloom within the predicted window.\n\n3. **Current Blossom Development**: As of March 24, 2025, cooler temperatures have slowed the development slightly, but the blossoms are still on track for the predicted peak bloom dates.\n\nConsidering these factors, there is a high probability that the cherry trees will reach peak bloom on March 31, 2025, as it falls within the predicted window and the weather conditions are conducive to blooming.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.7"
