  "question": "Will the maximum daily average CO₂ reported by the Mauna Loa Observatory for March 1-25, 2025 be greater than 430.5 ppm?",
  "probability": 0.95,
  "reasoning": "Based on the evidence gathered:\n\n1. On March 7, 2025, the Mauna Loa Observatory recorded a new all-time daily high of 430.60 ppm, which exceeds the threshold of 430.5 ppm. This indicates that the maximum daily average CO₂ level for the period in question has already surpassed the required threshold for a \"YES\" resolution.\n\n2. The CO₂ levels have been consistently rising each year, with a notable increase from 425.38 ppm in March 2024. The monthly average for February 2025 was 427.09 ppm, higher than the highest monthly average in 2024.\n\n3. The seasonal peak for daily CO₂ readings at Mauna Loa typically occurs in April or May, suggesting that March levels are likely to be high and potentially continue to rise.\n\n4. The annual increase in CO₂ at Mauna Loa is accelerating, indicating a trend of rising CO₂ levels.\n\nGiven this information, the probability that the maximum daily average CO₂ reported by the Mauna Loa Observatory for March 1-25, 2025, will be greater than 430.5 ppm is very high.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.95",

This is a very dangerous situation, as discussed elsewhere in this post.\n\nThe image below confirms the very high Arctic temperature anomalies in February 2025.\n\n\n\n\nThe image below illustrates the threat of a huge temperature rise. The red trend warns that the temperature could increase at a terrifying speed soon. The global surface air temperature was 13.87°C on March 8, 2025, the highest temperature on record for this day. This is the more remarkable since this record high temperature was reached during a La Niña.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe shading in the above image highlights the difference between El Niño conditions (pink shading) and La Niña conditions (blue shading). An El Niño pushes up temperatures, whereas La Niña suppresses temperatures. We're currently in a La Niña, so temperatures are suppressed, but this is predicted to end soon. NOAA predicts a transition away from La Niña to occur next month.\n\nThe transition from La Niña to El Niño is only one out of ten mechanisms that could jointly cause the temperature rise to accelerate dramatically in a matter of months, as described in a\n\n\n\nThe daily average carbon dioxide (CO₂) at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, was 430.60 parts per million (ppm) on March 7, 2025, the highest daily average on record. To find higher levels, one needs to go back millions of years.\nCarbon dioxide typically reaches its annual maximum in May, which means that even higher daily averages can be expected over the next few months. The image below shows that this reading of 430.6 ppm at Mauna Loa is way higher than the highest daily averages recorded in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, the high angle of the Sun produces long days, w…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 386 words out of ~1985.

In that time, [measured background CO2](https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/about/co2_measurements.html) has risen from 313 parts per million (ppm) to the most recent (February 6, 2025) reading of 428.6 ppm, a 37% increase and a phenomenon known as the [Keeling Curve](https://www.acs.org/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/keeling-curve.html):&#x20;\n\n![](https://gml.noaa.gov/webdata/ccgg/trends/co2_data_mlo.png)\n\nCO₂ levels have seasonal fluctuations [due to](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/during-year-extremes-carbon-dioxide-levels-surge-faster-ever) the growing season in the Northern Hemisphere, with the period of late September through May being a period of rising CO₂ coinciding with the northern fall and winter. Since records have been kept at Mauna Loa, each March has had a higher [monthly mean](https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/data.html) level of CO₂ than the previous year's March, with the past decade as follows:\n\n| Year | CO₂ ppm | YoY increase |\n| ---- | ------- | ------------ |\n| 2010 | 391.37  | 0.60%        |\n| 2011 | 392.8   | 0.37%        |\n| 2012 | 394.59  | 0.46%        |\n| 2013 | 397.66  | 0.78%        |\n| 2014 | 399.91  | 0.57%        |\n| 2015 | 401.74  | 0.46%        |\n| 2016 | 405.06  | 0.83%        |\n| 2017 | 407.54  | 0.61%        |\n| 2018 | 409.59  | 0.50%        |\n| 2019 | 412.18  | 0.63%        |\n| 2020 | 414.72  | 0.62%        |\n| 2021 | 417.61  | 0.70%        |\n| 2022 | 418.76  | 0.28%        |\n| 2023 | 420.99  | 0.53%        |\n| 2024 | 425.38  | 1.04%        |\n\nCO₂ is a [greenhouse gas](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-atmospheric-carbon-dioxide), with a [high correlation](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep21691) between rising CO₂ levels and increased surface temperatures.\nResolution criteria: This question resolves as YES if the maximum daily average carbon dioxide (CO₂) level for the time period March 1, 2025 to March 25, 2025 (inclusive) is greater than 430.5 ppm, according to data reported by the Mauna Loa Observatory of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Global Monitoring Laboratory. (See Fine Print for detailed instructions on accessing the data.)\n\nThe question will resolve when the data is assessed by Metaculus on March 28, 2025. Later updates or revisions to the data after the question has resolved are immaterial.\nFine print: If a daily mean for any of the dates is missing on March 28, 2025, resolution will wait until March 31, 2025 for the data to become complete. If at that time 13 or more of the daily means are available, then the question will resolve based on that data. If fewer than 13 daily means for the period in question are available before 5 PM Eastern Time on March 31, 2025, then this question will be **annulled**.\n\nDETAILED INSTRUCTIONS TO ACCESS DATA:\n\n1. Go to \"Trends in Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide (CO₂)\" for Mauna Loa, Hawaii [here](https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/data.html) and access the \"Data\" tab.\n2. Download the \"Mauna Loa CO₂ daily means\" CSV file.\n3. Column A corresponds to the year, Column B corresponds to the month number (March is 3), and Column C corresponds to the date.\n4. Column E is the CO₂ reading for each date.\n5. Resolution amount will be the maximum CO₂ reading for the dates March 1, 2025 through March 25, 2025. The Excel/Google Sheets command is MAX, so for example if the data appears in rows 15610 through 15634, the formula is =max(E15610:E15634).\npresent_date: 2025-03-20T15:43:34.430131\n\n\nMake sure to use the tools at your disposal to gather relevant information before providing your final probability estimate.\n\nYou may reason through the problem, but you MUST end your response with:\nFINAL PROBABILITY: [your decimal number between 0 and 1]"

It shows that CO2 levels usually peak in April or May, a phenomena discovered by Charles David Keeling in the late 1950s and early 1960s when he began what became the world's longest-running, high preceision record of direct measurements of CO2 in background air.
