  "question": "Will Tesla's total vehicle deliveries for Q1 2025 be less than 400,000 vehicles?",
  "probability": 0.7,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here is the analysis of Tesla's Q1 2025 vehicle deliveries:\n\n1. **Analyst Consensus**: The consensus among analysts is that Tesla will deliver approximately 418,000 vehicles in Q1 2025, which is above the 400,000 threshold. This suggests a year-over-year improvement and indicates that deliveries might not fall below 400,000. However, there are factors that could affect this outcome.\n\n2. **Prediction Markets**: Kalshi, a prediction market, forecasts 359,000 deliveries for Q1 2025. Similarly, the Metaculus community prediction is 356,000 deliveries, with a range of 350,000 to 369,000. Both predictions are below 400,000, indicating a significant probability that deliveries will be less than 400,000.\n\n3. **Impact of Protests and Political Involvement**: The \"Tesla Takedown\" movement and Elon Musk's political involvement have led to protests and vandalism, potentially affecting Tesla's operations and deliveries. However, the impact on sales is debated, with some polls suggesting limited effect.\n\n4. **Regional Sales Trends**: Sales in Europe and China have seen significant declines, with European sales down by as much as 50% and Chinese sales nearly halved. This could contribute to lower overall delivery numbers.\n\n5. **Stock Market and Analyst Sentiment**: Tesla's stock has dropped significantly, reflecting pessimism about sales. UBS Global Research expects a 5% decline in deliveries for the quarter compared to the previous year.\n\nConsidering these factors, there is substantial evidence suggesting that Tesla's Q1 2025 deliveries may indeed fall below 400,000 vehicles, despite some analyst predictions to the contrary. The prediction markets and regional sales declines weigh heavily towards a lower delivery number.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.7",

However, Tesla reported its [first decline in annual vehicle deliveries](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/02/tesla-tsla-q4-2024-vehicle-delivery-and-production-numbers.html) in 2024. Despite the annual decline during 2024, the fourth quarter of 2024 saw its largest number of deliveries, [reporting](https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-fourth-quarter-2024-production-deliveries-and-deployments) 495,570 cars delivered.\n\nHowever, some analysts [think](https://x.com/TroyTeslike/status/1894654134730530882) that Tesla CEO [Elon Musk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk)'s recent political involvement with President Donald Trump and the [Department of Government Efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Government_Efficiency) (DOGE) may harm Tesla's delivery prospects. [Reports](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-stores-vehicles-chargers-vandalism-protests/#google_vignette) of protests against Tesla and Tesla vehicles being vandalized and defaced have gone viral on social media.\n\nTesla [typically reports](https://ir.tesla.com/press) quarterly deliveries ahead of its full earnings, usually on the second day of the following quarter.\nResolution criteria: This question will resolve as YES if Tesla's total vehicle deliveries for Q1 2025 are less than 400,000 vehicles, and NO otherwise, based on figures [reported by Tesla](https://ir.tesla.com/press). For example, [for Q4 2024](https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-fourth-quarter-2024-production-deliveries-and-deployments) the equivalent number was 495,570.\nFine print: * If the delivery figures for Q1 2025 are not published by Tesla before April 7, 2025, this question will be **annulled**.\npresent_date: 2025-03-25T14:10:39.109542\n\n\nMake sure to use the tools at your disposal to gather relevant information before providing your final probability estimate.\n\nYou may reason through the problem, but you MUST end your response with:\nFINAL PROBABILITY: [your decimal number between 0 and 1]"

      "content": "Based on the gathered evidence, here is the analysis of Tesla's Q1 2025 vehicle deliveries:\n\n1. **Analyst Consensus**: The consensus among analysts is that Tesla will deliver approximately 418,000 vehicles in Q1 2025, which is above the 400,000 threshold. This suggests a year-over-year improvement and indicates that deliveries might not fall below 400,000. However, there are factors that could affect this outcome.\n\n2. **Prediction Markets**: Kalshi, a prediction market, forecasts 359,000 deliveries for Q1 2025. Similarly, the Metaculus community prediction is 356,000 deliveries, with a range of 350,000 to 369,000. Both predictions are below 400,000, indicating a significant probability that deliveries will be less than 400,000.\n\n3. **Impact of Protests and Political Involvement**: The \"Tesla Takedown\" movement and Elon Musk's political involvement have led to protests and vandalism, potentially affecting Tesla's operations and deliveries. However, the impact on sales is debated, with some polls suggesting limited effect.\n\n4. **Regional Sales Trends**: Sales in Europe and China have seen significant declines, with European sales down by as much as 50% and Chinese sales nearly halved. This could contribute to lower overall delivery numbers.\n\n5. **Stock Market and Analyst Sentiment**: Tesla's stock has dropped significantly, reflecting pessimism about sales. UBS Global Research expects a 5% decline in deliveries for the quarter compared to the previous year.\n\nConsidering these factors, there is substantial evidence suggesting that Tesla's Q1 2025 deliveries may indeed fall below 400,000 vehicles, despite some analyst predictions to the contrary. The prediction markets and regional sales declines weigh heavily towards a lower delivery number.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.7"
