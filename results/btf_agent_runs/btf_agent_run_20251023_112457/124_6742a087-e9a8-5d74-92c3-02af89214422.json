  "question": "Will there be exactly 10 people in space on March 29, 2025, according to whoisinspace.com?",
  "probability": 0.9,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here is the current situation regarding the number of people in space as of March 21, 2025:\n\n1. **Current Count**: There are currently 10 people in space. This includes 7 people on the International Space Station (ISS) and 3 people on the Tiangong Space Station.\n\n2. **Recent Changes**: \n   - Crew-9 returned to Earth on March 18, 2025, and Crew-10 arrived at the ISS on March 16, 2025. This handover maintained the ISS crew at 7 people.\n   - There are no scheduled launches or returns that would affect the number of people in space before March 29, 2025.\n\n3. **Future Missions**: \n   - Soyuz MS-27 is scheduled to launch to the ISS on April 8, 2025, and Soyuz MS-26 is scheduled to return to Earth on April 20, 2025. These missions will not affect the crew count on March 29, 2025.\n\nGiven the current stability in the number of people in space and the lack of scheduled changes before March 29, 2025, it is likely that the number of people in space will remain at 10 on that date.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.9",

Today, that dream has become a reality for a select few.\n\nSo, how many people are in space right now? In this article, we’ll discover the names of the brave men and women currently living and working aboard the [ two space stations currently in orbit around the planet](https://starlust.org/how-many-space-stations-are-currently-in-orbit/).\n\n## As of March 21, 2025 there are 10 people currently living and working in space.\n\n### Here's a quick rundown 👇\n\n- 4 Astronauts\n- 3 Cosmonauts\n- 3 Taikonauts\n\n### By Country 🌍\n\n- 2 Americans 🇺🇸\n- 3 Russians 🇷🇺\n- 3 Chinese 🇨🇳\n- 1 Japanese 🇯🇵\n- 1 Danish 🇩🇰\n\n## There are currently 7 people onboard the ISS\n\nThe crew of the ISS is usually made up of seven people from different countries, reflecting the collaborative and international nature of the space station. When a new crew arrives and departs, there may be a temporary overlap period during which the number of crew members exceeds the usual limit.\n\n### Oleg Kononenko\n\nISS commander\n\nOleg Dmitriyevich Kononenko is a highly experienced Russian cosmonaut who has undertaken five missions to the International Space Station, serving variously as a flight engineer and commander, and accumulating over 788 days in orbit, the most of any currently active cosmonaut or astronaut\n\n**Oleg joined the ISS via the Soyuz MS-24 spacecraft. He has been in space since September 2023.**\n\n### Nikolai Chub\n\nFlight Engineer\n\nNikolay Aleksandrovich Chub is a Russian cosmonaut selected by Roscosmos in 2012, who rose through the ranks after excelling in management and informatics, as well as economics, and heading the company Space Tu, LLC. Chub has faced challenges such as initially being denied a U.S. visa critical for ISS safety training but was later granted entry, and after serving as a backup for several missions.\n\n**Nikolai joined the ISS via the Soyuz MS-24 spacecraft.

The spacecraft, launched last October on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket, aims to study Europa’s potential to support life. It is expected to reach Jupiter’s orbit by 2030. Another gravity assist is planned for December 2026, when the Clipper flies past Earth.\n\n**March 2: NASA does double duty.** A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will lift off from California’s Vandenberg Space Force Base, carrying two NASA projects: The SPHEREx space telescope will map the sky in infrared to study the universe’s formation. The PUNCH mission, consisting of four small satellites, will monitor the Sun’s corona as it transitions into solar wind.\n\n**March 3: SpaceX’s eighth Starship test.** Originally set for February, SpaceX has moved its eighth Starship test flight to March 3. The last test in January ended in failure when the upper-stage capsule exploded mid-flight due to propellant leaks. This time, SpaceX will again attempt to catch the Super Heavy booster with its [“chopstick” catch system,](https://observer.com/2024/10/spacex-fifth-starship-flight-test-historic-milestone/) a maneuver it has successfully completed twice. The mission will also carry four dummy Starlink simulators to practice satellite deployment.\n\n**March 12: ESA’s Mars flyby. **NASA’s Europa Clipper isn’t the only spacecraft flying by Mars this month—the European Space Agency’s Hera mission will also get a gravity assist when it passes by the planet on March 12. Launched last fall, Hera plans to spend the next year traveling to an asteroid that was impacted by a NASA mission in 2022 practicing asteroid deflection techniques, where it will gather information on the Didymos asteroid system.\n\n**March 12: NASA astronauts finally get a ride home.** NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore will finally return to Earth after an eight-month stay on the ISS.

The crew currently assigned to the U.S. Orbital Segment on the Station has completed its handover, with Crew-9 returning to Earth on March 18 and Crew-10 arriving just days earlier.\n\nThe Station is also being prepared for a crew handover in April on the Russian Segment and an imminent departure of a cargo ship. The visiting vehicle complement has changed several times since 2025 began, and more changes loom in April after a pair of upcoming launches.\n\n\n**Crew handovers**\n\nAfter the Boeing Crew Flight Test astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were incorporated into the Crew-9 mission following the departure of Starliner *Calypso* without them, they spent an extra six months aboard the Station to bring their time in space to nine months. Wilmore and Williams served a regular ISS rotation on Crew-9 along with mission commander Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov.\n\nCrew-10, carrying four crew members aboard Crew Dragon *Endurance*, launched to the International Space Station (ISS) from the Kennedy Space Center on March 14 after a scrub on March 12 due to a ground support equipment issue. The crew, consisting of NASA’s Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers along with JAXA’s Takuya Onishi and Roscosmos’ Kirill Peskov, docked at the *Harmony* module’s forward port on the Station at 04:04 UTC on Sunday, March 16.\n\nCrew handovers on the U.S. Orbital Segment (USOS) normally last for a few days as the departing crew assists the arriving crew with transitioning to Station activities and operations. The handover between Crew-9 and Crew-10 was shorter than usual as NASA moved up Crew-9’s return by a few days due to an unfavorable weather forecast for the end of the week. Another factor in the decision was to conserve consumables due to a potential delay in an upcoming Cygnus cargo flight.\n\nThe Crew-9 astronauts boarded Crew Dragon *Freedom*, docked to the zenit…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 382 words out of ~1365.

The spacecraft, launched last October on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket, aims to study Europa’s potential to support life. It is expected to reach Jupiter’s orbit by 2030. Another gravity assist is planned for December 2026, when the Clipper flies past Earth.\n\n**March 2: NASA does double duty.** A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will lift off from California’s Vandenberg Space Force Base, carrying two NASA projects: The SPHEREx space telescope will map the sky in infrared to study the universe’s formation. The PUNCH mission, consisting of four small satellites, will monitor the Sun’s corona as it transitions into solar wind.\n\n**March 3: SpaceX’s eighth Starship test.** Originally set for February, SpaceX has moved its eighth Starship test flight to March 3. The last test in January ended in failure when the upper-stage capsule exploded mid-flight due to propellant leaks. This time, SpaceX will again attempt to catch the Super Heavy booster with its [“chopstick” catch system,](https://observer.com/2024/10/spacex-fifth-starship-flight-test-historic-milestone/) a maneuver it has successfully completed twice.

The spacecraft, launched last October on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket, aims to study Europa\\u2019s potential to support life. It is expected to reach Jupiter\\u2019s orbit by 2030.
