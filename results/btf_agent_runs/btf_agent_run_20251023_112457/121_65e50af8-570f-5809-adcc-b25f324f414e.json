  "question": "Will the total number of forecasters in the Q1 2025 Quarterly Cup be between 400 and 800 forecasters (inclusive)?",
  "probability": 0.75,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here is the analysis for the probability that the total number of forecasters in the Q1 2025 Quarterly Cup will be between 400 and 800 forecasters (inclusive):\n\n1. **Historical Participation**: The number of forecasters in previous Quarterly Cups has varied, with a notable drop to 379 in Q4 2024, likely due to a site rewrite. However, participation in earlier quarters was generally higher, often exceeding 700.\n\n2. **Community Prediction**: The community median prediction for the number of forecasters in the Q1 2025 Quarterly Cup is 563, with a range between 466 and 676. This range falls within the 400-800 forecasters bracket, indicating a strong expectation that participation will be within this range.\n\n3. **New User Signups**: Early 2025 saw a record number of new user signups on Metaculus, with 11,050 new users joining from January 27 to February 2, 2025. This influx of new users could potentially increase participation in the Quarterly Cup.\n\n4. **Other Tournaments**: The ACX2025 and Bridgewater Forecasting Contest have attracted significant participation, with the Bridgewater contest registering over 17,000 competitors globally. While these tournaments may draw attention away from the Quarterly Cup, they also indicate a high level of engagement on the platform.\n\n5. **Influence of New Tournaments**: The launch of multiple high-profile tournaments in early 2025, including the ACX2025 and Brazil Prediction Tournament, could influence user participation in the Quarterly Cup. However, the community prediction suggests a reasonable level of participation in the Quarterly Cup itself.\n\nConsidering these factors, the probability that the total number of forecasters in the Q1 2025 Quarterly Cup will be between 400 and 800 forecasters is high. The community prediction aligns well with this range, and the influx of new users, along with the historical data, supports this expectation.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.75",

The original post covers technical improvements, new forecasting tournaments, and collaborations with CDC, GiveWell, Bridgewater Associates, Bright Line Watch, and more. While written for regular Metaculus users, I'm sharing it as a resource for those interested in Metaculus's recent work and potential ways to participate.\n\nThe Metaculus of early 2025 is a different and better place in myriad ways than the Metaculus of a year ago. It can be easy to miss some of these changes and also some of the opportunities — to sharpen thinking (yours and others'), to win prizes and job opportunities, and to contribute to public sense-making in turbulent times.\n\nThis post covers Metaculus from mid-2024 to today, highlighting new developments and features you might have missed — from tournaments and research initiatives to ongoing experiments.\n\nWe were fortunate to work with many inspiring partners in 2024, on more projects than we could list below. If you or your organization want to collaborate with us in 2025, get in touch!\n\nAstral Codex Ten 2025 with Scott Alexander has become our fastest-growing series ever with over 3,000 forecasters so far — that's double last year's turnout. Even more dramatically, the return of the Bridgewater x Metaculus Forecasting Contest has registered over 17,000 (!) competitors globally, more than 10x last year's count. The past week has been one for the record books - each day shattered either our record for new forecasters or total predictions made. The Monday launch of the Bridgewater contest topped them all, hitting new all-time highs for forecasters, commenters, and signups.. (And yes, the platform is experiencing some growing pains as we welcome new users. We hope you make folks feel welcome, even as you maybe direct them to the Community Guidelines or Why Forecasting? pages.)\n\nEven before those record-breaking days, your predictions have been reaching ever broader audiences, with coverage spanning major outlets from Fast Company and Vox to Asterisk and AEI post…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 373 words out of ~3351.

Even more dramatically, the return of the Bridgewater x Metaculus Forecasting Contest has registered over 17,000 (!) competitors globally, more than 10x last year's count. The past week has been one for the record books - each day shattered either our record for new forecasters or total predictions made. The Monday launch of the Bridgewater contest topped them all, hitting new all-time highs for forecasters, commenters, and signups.. (And yes, the platform is experiencing some growing pains as we welcome new users. We hope you make folks feel welcome, even as you maybe direct them to the Community Guidelines or Why Forecasting? pages.)\\n\\nEven before those record-breaking days, your predictions have been reaching ever broader audiences, with coverage spanning major outlets from Fast Company and Vox to Asterisk and AEI post\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 373 words out of ~3351.

Quarterly Cups have been some of the most popular tournaments on the site with hundreds of users forecasting on at least one tournament question in each quarter. In the last quarter of 2024 participation dropped sharply, potentially as a result of users having to navigate the massive site rewrite that was published in early October.\\n\\nIn early 2025, Metaculus launched the ACX2025, the Brazil Prediction Tournament, and the 2025 Bridgewater Forecasting Contest, leading to a record number of users signing up for the site (11,050 from January 27 to February 2, 2025, almost five times the previous weekly record of 2,348 in October 2024!). It is unclear, though, what percentage of these users might forecast on questions outside of these prized tournaments.\\n\\nThe total number of forecasters for past Quarterly Cups can be found below.\\n\\n| Quarter | Total forecasters |\\n| ------- | ----------------- |\\n| Q3 2023 | 842               |\\n| Q4 2023 | 838               |\\n| Q1 2024 | 709               |\\n| Q2 2024 | 1002              |\\n| Q3 2024 | 760               |\\n| Q4 2024 | 379               |\", \"resolution_criteria\": \"This question will resolve as YES if the total number of forecasters that have submitted at least one forecast in any Q1 2025 Quarterly Cup question that has properly resolved (besides this one) is between 400 and 800 forecasters (inclusive). The number will be found on the bottom of the relevant leaderboard after all questions besides this one have been resolved.\", \"present_date\": \"2025-03-26T03:21:50.074755\"}"

      "content": "Based on the gathered evidence, here is the analysis for the probability that the total number of forecasters in the Q1 2025 Quarterly Cup will be between 400 and 800 forecasters (inclusive):\n\n1. **Historical Participation**: The number of forecasters in previous Quarterly Cups has varied, with a notable drop to 379 in Q4 2024, likely due to a site rewrite. However, participation in earlier quarters was generally higher, often exceeding 700.\n\n2. **Community Prediction**: The community median prediction for the number of forecasters in the Q1 2025 Quarterly Cup is 563, with a range between 466 and 676. This range falls within the 400-800 forecasters bracket, indicating a strong expectation that participation will be within this range.\n\n3. **New User Signups**: Early 2025 saw a record number of new user signups on Metaculus, with 11,050 new users joining from January 27 to February 2, 2025. This influx of new users could potentially increase participation in the Quarterly Cup.\n\n4. **Other Tournaments**: The ACX2025 and Bridgewater Forecasting Contest have attracted significant participation, with the Bridgewater contest registering over 17,000 competitors globally. While these tournaments may draw attention away from the Quarterly Cup, they also indicate a high level of engagement on the platform.\n\n5. **Influence of New Tournaments**: The launch of multiple high-profile tournaments in early 2025, including the ACX2025 and Brazil Prediction Tournament, could influence user participation in the Quarterly Cup. However, the community prediction suggests a reasonable level of participation in the Quarterly Cup itself.\n\nConsidering these factors, the probability that the total number of forecasters in the Q1 2025 Quarterly Cup will be between 400 and 800 forecasters is high. The community prediction aligns well with this range, and the influx of new users, along with the historical data, supports this expectation.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.75"
