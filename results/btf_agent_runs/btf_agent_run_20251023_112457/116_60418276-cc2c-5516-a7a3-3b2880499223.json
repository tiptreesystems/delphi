  "question": "Will Donald Trump grant executive clemency to more than 2 individuals in February 2025?",
  "probability": 0.1,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence:\n\n1. **Rod Blagojevich** was pardoned by Donald Trump in February 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources, including NPR.\n2. There is no evidence of additional clemency actions taken by Trump in February 2025 beyond the pardon of Rod Blagojevich. The sources reviewed, including Politico and Holland & Knight, do not mention any new clemency actions beyond those related to the January 6 events, which were issued in January 2025.\n3. The White House proclamation from January 2025 included mass pardons related to January 6, but these actions occurred before February 2025 and are not relevant to the February count.\n4. As of February 20, 2025, only one individual, Rod Blagojevich, was reported to have received clemency in February 2025.\n\nGiven this information, it seems unlikely that Trump has granted clemency to more than two individuals in February 2025. Therefore, the probability that Trump will grant clemency to more than two individuals in February 2025 is low.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1",

The guns in question were found at the two men’s homes during the Jan. 6 investigation, but the alleged gun crimes themselves were not connected to the riot.\n\nNonetheless, prosecutors moved to dismiss the gun cases by invoking Trump’s Day 1 executive order [granting mass clemency](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/20/donald-trump-jan6-pardons-00199532) to Jan. 6 defendants.\n\n[That order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/granting-pardons-and-commutation-of-sentences-for-certain-offenses-relating-to-the-events-at-or-near-the-united-states-capitol-on-january-6-2021/) issued pardons to roughly 1,500 people who had been convicted of “offenses related to events that occurred at or near the United States Capitol” on Jan. 6, 2021. It also directed the attorney general to dismiss all pending prosecutions for “conduct related to” those events.\n\nThe expansive reading of Trump’s clemency order marks the latest push by the new administration to absolve Jan. 6 defendants, whom Trump and his supporters have described as political prisoners and victims of persecution.\n\nThe two men whose charges are being dropped — Daniel Ball and Elias Costianes — both had been awaiting trial on Jan. 6-related charges when Trump took office. Ball faced charges of assault, while Costianes had misdemeanor charges pending. Those cases quickly disappeared as a result of Trump’s clemency. But in separate proceedings, they also had both been accused of illegally possessing weapons that law enforcement officers discovered in Jan. 6-related searches.\n\nA day after Trump ordered…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 335 words out of ~857.

Rod Blagojevich\n\nPresident Trump has pardoned former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who was convicted of corruption-related crimes, including trying to sell a U.S. Senate seat vacated by former President Barack Obama.\n\nBlagojevich served as the state's governor from 2003-'09. It was a political saga toward the end of his time in office.\n\nIn 2008, federal prosecutors accused Blagojevich of turning Illinois' government into a moneymaking operation for himself by trying to, among other things, shake down a children's hospital and racetrack owners. When prosecutors charged Blagojevich with corruption over the Senate seat, they presented as evidence a profanity-filled telephone conversation he had that was secretly recorded by the FBI.\n\n\"I mean, I've got this thing, and it's [expletive] golden. And I'm just not giving it up for [expletive] nothing,\" Blagojevich said.\n\nHe argued that he simply engaged in political horse-trading, and he went on a national publicity tour to proclaim his innocence.\n\nBlagojevich was impeached and ousted as governor in January 2009 and then indicted that March. The following year, he appeared and was booted off Donald Trump's reality TV show, *Celebrity Apprentice*.\n\nBlagojevich was convicted in 2011 and later sentenced to 14 years in prison. He served eight years, his time behind bars cut short after President Trump commuted Blagojevich's sentence during his first term in office.\n\nMany leading Illinois Democrats and Republicans criticized the move. The then-chairman of Illinois' Republican Party said in a statement that in a state where corrupt machine style politics is all too common, it's important that those found guilty serve their prison sentence in its entirety.\n\nAfter he was released from prison, Blagojevich and his wife, Patti, held a news conference. He said he was a freed political prisoner, calling the criminal justice system both broken and unfair.\n\n\"We want to express our most profound an…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 367 words out of ~428.

The Justice Department now says that President Donald Trump’s clemency for Jan. 6 rioters covers unrelated crimes that were discovered during FBI searches stemming from the attack on the Capitol. Federal prosecutors revealed the new legal position this week in court papers seeking to drop gun charges against two former Jan. 6 defendants. The guns in question were found at the two men’s homes during the Jan. 6 investigation, but the alleged gun crimes themselves were not connected to the riot. Nonetheless, prosecutors moved to dismiss the gun cases by invoking Trump’s Day 1 executive order granting mass clemency to Jan. 6 defendants. That order issued pardons to roughly 1,500 people who had been convicted of “offenses related to events that occurred at or near the United States Capitol” on Jan. 6, 2021. It also directed the attorney general to dismiss all pending prosecutions for “conduct related to” those events. The expansive reading of Trump’s clemency order marks the latest push by the new administration to absolve Jan. 6 defendants, whom Trump and his supporters have described as political prisoners and victims of persecution. The two men whose charges are being dropped — Daniel Ball and Elias Costianes — both had been awaiting trial on Jan. 6-related charges when Trump took office. Ball faced charges of assault, while Costianes had misdemeanor charges pending. Those cases quickly disappeared as a result of Trump’s clemency. But in separate proceedings, they also had both been accused of illegally possessing weapons that law enforcement officers discovered in Jan. 6-related searches. A day after Trump ordered the clemency, the Justice Department began implementing the new policy, which has led to the dismissal of numerous cases.\", \"question\": \"Will Donald Trump grant executive clemency to more than 2 individuals in February 2025?\", \"background\": \"As of February 20, 2025, this was one individual: Rod Blagojevich\", \"resolution_criteria\": \"This question resolves as **Yes** if Donald J.

      "content": "Based on the gathered evidence:\n\n1. **Rod Blagojevich** was pardoned by Donald Trump in February 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources, including NPR.\n2. There is no evidence of additional clemency actions taken by Trump in February 2025 beyond the pardon of Rod Blagojevich. The sources reviewed, including Politico and Holland & Knight, do not mention any new clemency actions beyond those related to the January 6 events, which were issued in January 2025.\n3. The White House proclamation from January 2025 included mass pardons related to January 6, but these actions occurred before February 2025 and are not relevant to the February count.\n4. As of February 20, 2025, only one individual, Rod Blagojevich, was reported to have received clemency in February 2025.\n\nGiven this information, it seems unlikely that Trump has granted clemency to more than two individuals in February 2025. Therefore, the probability that Trump will grant clemency to more than two individuals in February 2025 is low.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1"
