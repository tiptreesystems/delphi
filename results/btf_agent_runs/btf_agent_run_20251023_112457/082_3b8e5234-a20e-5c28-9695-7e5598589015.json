  "question": "Will Victoria Monét win the 2025 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Music Artist?",
  "probability": 0.15,
  "reasoning": "Based on the search results, here is what we know:\n\n1. **Nomination Status**: Victoria Monét has been nominated for the Outstanding Music Artist category at the 36th Annual GLAAD Media Awards. This is confirmed by multiple sources, including UPI.com and Blue Fox Entertainment.\n\n2. **Competition**: Other nominees in the same category include well-known artists such as Billie Eilish, Doechii, Elton John, Joy Oladokun, Kali Uchis, Omar Apollo, Orville Peck, and Tove Lo. This indicates a competitive field.\n\n3. **Cultural Impact and Recent Work**: There were no specific results found regarding Victoria Monét's recent music releases in 2025 and their cultural impact. However, her nomination itself suggests that her work has had a significant impact, at least enough to be recognized by GLAAD.\n\nGiven this information, Victoria Monét is a nominee, which means she has a chance of winning. However, the presence of other strong contenders makes it difficult to assign a high probability without more detailed insights into the current cultural impact and reception of her work compared to the other nominees.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.15",

This is confirmed by multiple sources, including UPI.com and Blue Fox Entertainment.\n\n2. **Competition**: Other nominees in the same category include well-known artists such as Billie Eilish, Doechii, Elton John, Joy Oladokun, Kali Uchis, Omar Apollo, Orville Peck, and Tove Lo. This indicates a competitive field.\n\n3. **Cultural Impact and Recent Work**: There were no specific results found regarding Victoria Monét's recent music releases in 2025 and their cultural impact. However, her nomination itself suggests that her work has had a significant impact, at least enough to be recognized by GLAAD.\n\nGiven this information, Victoria Monét is a nominee, which means she has a chance of winning. However, the presence of other strong contenders makes it difficult to assign a high probability without more detailed insights into the current cultural impact and reception of her work compared to the other nominees.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.15"
