To be eligible to win prizes in the competition you must register for the tournament. The last day to register is March 24, 2025. Sign up or check your registration status* [*here*](https://www.metaculus.com/bridgewater/)*.*\n\n***\n\nThe Rubik's Cube was invented in 1974, released in 1980, and had its first world 'speedcubing' championship [just 8 years later](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedcubing#History). The winner achieved a world record of 22.95 seconds. Since then, [17 more people](https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/history-of-the-world-record-evolution/) have held this record, lowering the time to below 4 seconds.
