  "question": "Will the number of confirmed cases in the Texas measles outbreak exceed 500 by April 7, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.75,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered information, here are the key points relevant to estimating the probability of the Texas measles outbreak exceeding 500 confirmed cases by April 7, 2025:\n\n1. **Current Case Count**: As of March 25, 2025, there are 327 confirmed measles cases in Texas. This is a significant increase from 146 cases on February 28, 2025.\n\n2. **Rate of Increase**: The number of cases has more than doubled in less than a month, indicating a rapid spread of the outbreak.\n\n3. **Vaccination Status**: The outbreak is primarily affecting unvaccinated individuals, with 325 out of 327 cases being unvaccinated or having unknown vaccination status. This suggests a high potential for further spread among unvaccinated populations.\n\n4. **Geographic Spread**: The outbreak has spread to multiple counties within Texas and has crossed state lines into New Mexico and Oklahoma, indicating a potential for further geographic spread.\n\n5. **Public Health Response**: Efforts to increase vaccination rates have been slow, and experts warn that the outbreak could become a nationwide epidemic if vaccination rates do not improve and stricter quarantine measures are not implemented.\n\n6. **Expert Predictions**: Public health officials predict it could take Texas a year to contain the spread of measles, and the rapid increase in cases suggests that the outbreak is not yet under control.\n\nGiven the current trajectory of the outbreak, the rapid increase in cases, and the high number of unvaccinated individuals, it is plausible that the number of confirmed cases could exceed 500 by April 7, 2025.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.75",

At this time, 327 cases have been identified since late January. Forty of the patients have been hospitalized.\n\nThere has been one fatality in a school-aged child who lived in the outbreak area. The child was not vaccinated and had no known underlying conditions.\n\nDue to the highly contagious nature of this disease, additional cases are likely to occur in the outbreak area and the surrounding communities. DSHS is working with local health departments to investigate the outbreak.\n\n**We will post updates on Tuesdays and Fridays.**\n\n| County | Cases |\n|---|---|\n| Cochran | 7 |\n| Dallam | 6 |\n| Dawson | 13 |\n| Ector | 2 |\n| Gaines | 226 |\n| Garza | 1 |\n| Hale | 1 |\n| Hockley | 1 |\n| Lamar | 5 |\n| Lamb | 1 |\n| Lubbock | 10 |\n| Lynn | 1 |\n| Martin | 3 |\n| Terry | 37 |\n| Yoakum | 13 |\nTotal |\n327 |\n\nAll data is provisional and subject to change.\n\n| 0 - 4 years | 5 - 17 years | 18+ years | Pending |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 105 | 140 | 63 | 19 |\n\n| Unvaccinated/Unknown | 325 |\n| Vaccinated: 1 dose | 0 |\n| Vaccinated: 2+ doses | 2 |\n\n- Note: The unvaccinated/unknown category includes people with no documented doses of measles vaccine more than 14 days before symptom onset.\n\nAfter additional investigation into the details of individual measles cases, DSHS has determined that three cases previously classified as vaccinated were not vaccinated cases. Two of those cases got their vaccine doses one to two days before their symptoms started, after they had been exposed to the virus. It takes the body about 14 days after vaccination to develop immunity to measles, so people aren’t considered vaccinated until that 14-day period has passed.\n\nDSHS has determined that the third case was a Lubbock County resident who had a vaccine reaction rather than a measles infection based on the results of [MeVA testing](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/php/laboratories/genetic-analysis.html#cdc_generic_section_7-identification-of-measles-vaccine-reactions), which detected the vaccine strain. This case has been removed from the case count entirely. The measles vaccine can occasionally cause a reaction with a rash and fever that mimic measles, but it is not…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 428 words out of ~703.

With cases continuously rising and the rest of the country’s unvaccinated population at the outbreak’s mercy, Texas must create stricter quarantine requirements, increase the vaccine rate, and improve contact tracing to address this measles epidemic before it becomes a nationwide problem, warn infectious disease experts and officials in other states.\n\n“This demonstrates that this (vaccine exemption) policy puts the community, the county, and surrounding states at risk because of how contagious this disease is,” said Glenn Fennelly, a [specialist](https://ttpelpaso.com/providers/Glenn_Fennelly.aspx) in pediatric infectious diseases and assistant vice president of global health at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso. “We…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 325 words out of ~2652.

At this time, 327 cases have been identified since late January. Forty of the patients have been hospitalized.\n\nThere has been one fatality in a school-aged child who lived in the outbreak area. The child was not vaccinated and had no known underlying conditions.\n\nDue to the highly contagious nature of this disease, additional cases are likely to occur in the outbreak area and the surrounding communities. DSHS is working with local health departments to investigate the outbreak.\n\n**We will post updates on Tuesdays and Fridays.**\n\n| County | Cases |\n|---|---|\n| Cochran | 7 |\n| Dallam | 6 |\n| Dawson | 13 |\n| Ector | 2 |\n| Gaines | 226 |\n| Garza | 1 |\n| Hale | 1 |\n| Hockley | 1 |\n| Lamar | 5 |\n| Lamb | 1 |\n| Lubbock | 10 |\n| Lynn | 1 |\n| Martin | 3 |\n| Terry | 37 |\n| Yoakum | 13 |\nTotal |\n327 |\n\nAll data is provisional and subject to change.\n\n| 0 - 4 years | 5 - 17 years | 18+ years | Pending |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 105 | 140 | 63 | 19 |\n\n| Unvaccinated/Unknown | 325 |\n| Vaccinated: 1 dose | 0 |\n| Vaccinated: 2+ doses | 2 |\n\n- Note: The unvaccinated/unknown category includes people with no documented doses of measles vaccine more than 14 days before symptom onset.\n\nAfter additional investigation into the details of individual measles cases, DSHS has determined that three cases previously classified as vaccinated were not vaccinated cases. Two of those cases got their vaccine doses one to two days before their symptoms started, after they had been exposed to the virus. It takes the body about 14 days after vaccination to develop immunity to measles, so people aren’t considered vaccinated until that 14-day period has passed.\n\nDSHS has determined that the third case was a Lubbock County resident who had a vaccine reaction rather than a measles infection based on the results of [MeVA testing](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/php/laboratories/genetic-analysis.html#cdc_generic_section_7-identification-of-measles-vaccine-reactions), which detected the vaccine strain. This case has been removed from the case count entirely. The measles vaccine can occasionally cause a reaction with a rash and fever that mimic measles, but it is not…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 428 words out of ~703.

At this time, 327 cases have been identified since late January. Forty of the patients have been hospitalized.\\n\\nThere has been one fatality in a school-aged child who lived in the outbreak area. The child was not vaccinated and had no known underlying conditions.\\n\\nDue to the highly contagious nature of this disease, additional cases are likely to occur in the outbreak area and the surrounding communities. DSHS is working with local health departments to investigate the outbreak.\\n\\n**We will post updates on Tuesdays and Fridays.**\\n\\n| County | Cases |\\n|---|---|\\n| Cochran | 7 |\\n| Dallam | 6 |\\n| Dawson | 13 |\\n| Ector | 2 |\\n| Gaines | 226 |\\n| Garza | 1 |\\n| Hale | 1 |\\n| Hockley | 1 |\\n| Lamar | 5 |\\n| Lamb | 1 |\\n| Lubbock | 10 |\\n| Lynn | 1 |\\n| Martin | 3 |\\n| Terry | 37 |\\n| Yoakum | 13 |\\nTotal |\\n327 |\\n\\nAll data is provisional and subject to change.\\n\\n| 0 - 4 years | 5 - 17 years | 18+ years | Pending |\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| 105 | 140 | 63 | 19 |\\n\\n| Unvaccinated/Unknown | 325 |\\n| Vaccinated: 1 dose | 0 |\\n| Vaccinated: 2+ doses | 2 |\\n\\n- Note: The unvaccinated/unknown category includes people with no documented doses of measles vaccine more than 14 days before symptom onset.\\n\\nAfter additional investigation into the details of individual measles cases, DSHS has determined that three cases previously classified as vaccinated were not vaccinated cases. Two of those cases got their vaccine doses one to two days before their symptoms started, after they had been exposed to the virus. It takes the body about 14 days after vaccination to develop immunity to measles, so people aren\\u2019t considered vaccinated until that 14-day period has passed.\\n\\nDSHS has determined that the third case was a Lubbock County resident who had a vaccine reaction rather than a measles infection based on the results of [MeVA testing](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/php/laboratories/genetic-analysis.html#cdc_generic_section_7-identification-of-measles-vaccine-reactions), which detected the vaccine strain. This case has been removed from the case count entirely.

This is a significant increase from 146 cases on February 28, 2025.\n\n2. **Rate of Increase**: The number of cases has more than doubled in less than a month, indicating a rapid spread of the outbreak.\n\n3. **Vaccination Status**: The outbreak is primarily affecting unvaccinated individuals, with 325 out of 327 cases being unvaccinated or having unknown vaccination status. This suggests a high potential for further spread among unvaccinated populations.\n\n4. **Geographic Spread**: The outbreak has spread to multiple counties within Texas and has crossed state lines into New Mexico and Oklahoma, indicating a potential for further geographic spread.\n\n5. **Public Health Response**: Efforts to increase vaccination rates have been slow, and experts warn that the outbreak could become a nationwide epidemic if vaccination rates do not improve and stricter quarantine measures are not implemented.\n\n6. **Expert Predictions**: Public health officials predict it could take Texas a year to contain the spread of measles, and the rapid increase in cases suggests that the outbreak is not yet under control.\n\nGiven the current trajectory of the outbreak, the rapid increase in cases, and the high number of unvaccinated individuals, it is plausible that the number of confirmed cases could exceed 500 by April 7, 2025.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.75"
