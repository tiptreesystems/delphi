  "question": "Will the number of active US drilling rigs be 590 to 594 on March 28, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.75,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here is the analysis for the probability that the number of active US drilling rigs will be between 590 and 594 on March 28, 2025:\n\n1. **Current Rig Count**: As of March 14, 2025, the total U.S. rig count is 592, with 487 oil rigs, 100 gas rigs, and 5 miscellaneous rigs. The rig count has remained stable at 592 for the weeks ending March 7 and March 14, 2025. This indicates a stabilization around the target range of 590-594.\n\n2. **Historical Trends**: The rig count has been fluctuating around the 590-594 range since February 2025, suggesting a stabilization in this range. This is a positive indicator for the probability of the count being within the desired range by March 28, 2025.\n\n3. **Market Influences**: Oil prices have been on a downswing as of January 2025, which could influence drilling activity. A Kansas City Fed survey indicated that a price of $89/barrel is needed for drilling to substantially increase, suggesting current prices may not support a significant rise in rig counts. However, the rig count has remained stable despite these price conditions.\n\n4. **Policy and Regulatory Environment**: President Trump has signed an executive order declaring a national energy emergency to increase oil and gas production, and the administration has issued directives to roll back regulations and accelerate drilling and pipeline development. However, many of these directives face legal challenges, creating uncertainty.\n\n5. **Industry Sentiment**: Executives from Exxon and TotalEnergies have expressed skepticism about increasing production due to a potential oil surplus in 2025, which could lead to throttling new production to avoid price destruction.\n\nGiven the current stabilization of the rig count around 592 and the influence of market and policy factors, the probability of the rig count being between 590 and 594 on March 28, 2025, is relatively high. The current count is already within this range, and there are no strong indicators of significant changes in the immediate future.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.75",

Image: Unsplash\n\n**The United States has vowed to increase oil and gas production.****A shift to renewables and other market forces, however, are also influencing the sector.****We ask Jeff Gustavson, President of Chevron New Energies, about how the industry is reacting.**\n\nIn January, on his first day back in the White House, US President Donald Trump signed an [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/declaring-a-national-energy-emergency/) declaring a national energy emergency. The move was followed by a [directive that aimed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/) to roll back regulations on the oil and gas sector, and accelerate drilling and pipeline development.\n\n“We will drill, baby, drill,” Trump said in his [inauguration speech](https://www.whitehouse.gov/remarks/2025/01/the-inaugural-address/), adding that the US has the “largest amount of oil and gas of any country on Earth — and we are going to use it.”\n\nYet some industry observers have speculated that [energy prices](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/business/energy-environment/oil-trump-drill-baby-drill.html) and [other market forces](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/oil-industry-unlikely-rush-alaska-despite-trumps-call-drill-2025-01-23/) may deter energy companies from increasing drilling, noting that the US has been the world's top [crude oil](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61545) and [liquefied natural gas](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61683) producer for several years now.

Additionally, Doug Bergum, Trump's nominee for Secretary of the Interior, [has promised](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/dec/01/doug-burgum-trump-interior-secretary-drilling) to open up federally-protected lands to expedited oil and gas drilling permits.\n\nHowever, OilPrice.com [reports](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Exxon-Pours-Cold-Water-On-Trumps-Drill-Baby-Drill-Plans.html) that it might not be this simple, quoting Exxon’s Upstream President Liam Mallon  and TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanne as saying it is more likely that oil producers, due to a looming surplus of oil in 2025 combined with a need to maximize shareholder returns on capital, may throttle new production in order to avoid price destruction.\n\nAccording to the Financial Times ([‘Drill, baby, drill’ is not so simple](https://www.ft.com/content/90468253-0560-4cb2-a302-2e8636234265)), a key factor will be oil prices. A Kansas City Fed survey of energy firms found that a price of \\$89/barrel was needed for drilling to substantially increase, while oil prices as of January 2025 have been on a downswing:\n\n![Price history](https://metaculus-web-media.s3.amazonaws.com/user_uploaded/Screenshot_2024-12-05_at_2.40.51%C3%A2PM.png)\n\nAccording to Baker Hughes in its recent [annual report](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1701605/000170160524000033/bkr-20231231.htm):\n\n> The Baker Hughes rig counts are an important business barometer for the drilling industry and its suppliers. When drilling rigs are active they consume products and services produced by the oil service industry. Rig count trends are driven by the exploration and development spending by oil and natural gas companies, which in turn is influenced by current and future price expectations for oil and natural gas. The counts may reflect the relative strength and stability of energy prices and overall market activity; however, these counts should not be solely relied on as other specific and pervasive conditions may exist that affect overall energy prices and market activity.\n\n> We have been providing rig counts to the public since 1944. We gather all relevant data through our field service personnel, who obtain the necessary data from routine visits to the various rigs, customers, contractors and other outside sources as necessary. We base the classification of a well as either oil or natural gas primarily upon filings made by operators in the relevant jurisdiction. This data is then compiled and distributed to various wire services and trade associations and is published on our website. We believe the counting process and resulting data is reliable; however, it is subject to our ability to obtain accurate and timely information. Rig counts are compiled weekly for the U.S. and Canada and monthly for all international rigs. Published international rig counts do not include rigs drilling in certain locations, such as onshore China because this information is not readily available.\n\n> Rigs in the U.S. and Canada are counted as active if, on the day the count is taken, the well being drilled has been started but drilling has not been completed and the well is anticipated to be of sufficient depth to be a potential consumer of our drill bits. In international areas, rigs are counted on a weekly basis and deemed active if drilling activities occurred during the majority of the week. The weekly results are then averaged for the month and published accordingly. The rig count does not include rigs that are in transit from one location to another, rigging up, being used in non-drilling activities including production testing, completion and workover, and are not expected to be significant consumers of drill bits.\n\nAccording to the rig count [FAQ](https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/rig-count-faqs), data is published each Friday at noon central US time. Recent reports have found the following rig count numbers:\n\n| Date               | Value | Date              | Value |\n| ------------------ | ----- | ----------------- | ----- |\n| January 31, 2025   | 582   | July 5, 2024      | 585   |\n| January 24, 2025   | 576   | June 28, 2024     | 581   |\n| January 17, 2025   | 580   | June 21, 2024     | 588   |\n| January 10, 2025   | 584   | June 14, 2024     | 590   |\n| January 3, 2025    | 589   | June 7, 2024      | 594   |\n| December 27, 2024  | 589   | May 31, 2024      | 600   |\n| December 20, 2024  | 589   | May 24, 2024      | 600   |\n| December 13, 2024  | 589   | May 17, 2024      | 604   |\n| December 6, 2024   | 589   | May 10, 2024      | 603   |\n| November 27, 2024  | 582   | May 3, 2024       | 605   |\n| November 22, 2024  | 583   | April 26, 2024    | 613   |\n| November 15, 2024  | 584   | April 19, 2024    | 619   |\n| November 8, 2024   | 585   | April 12, 2024    | 617   |\n| November 1, 2024   | 585   | April 5, 2024     | 620   |\n| October 25, 2024   | 585   | March 28, 2024    | 621   |\n| October 18, 2024   | 585   | March 22, 2024    | 624   |\n| October 11, 2024   | 586   | March 15, 2024    | 629   |\n| October 4, 2024    | 585   | March 8, 2024     | 622   |\n| September 27, 2024 | 587   | March 1, 2024     | 629   |\n| September 20, 2024 | 588   | February 23, 2024 | 626   |\n| September 13, 2024 | 590   | February 16, 2024 | 621   |\n| September 6, 2024  | 582   | February 9, 2024  | 623   |\n| August 30, 2024    | 583   | February 2, 2024  | 619   |\n| August 23, 2024    | 585   | January 26, 2024  | 621   |\n| August 16, 2024    | 586   | January 19, 2024  | 620   |\n| August 9, 2024     | 588   | January 12, 2024  | 619   |\n| August 2, 2024     | 586   | January 5, 2024   | 621   |\n| July 26, 2024      | 589   | December 29, 2023 | 622   |\n| July 19, 2024      | 586   | December 21, 2023 | 620   |\n| July 12, 2024      | 584   |                   |       |\nResolution criteria: This question resolves as YES if the last count of active US drilling rigs for the week ending March 28, 2025, according to the Baker Hughes North America Rig Count, is between 590 and 594 inclusive.

      "content": "Based on the gathered evidence, here is the analysis for the probability that the number of active US drilling rigs will be between 590 and 594 on March 28, 2025:\n\n1. **Current Rig Count**: As of March 14, 2025, the total U.S. rig count is 592, with 487 oil rigs, 100 gas rigs, and 5 miscellaneous rigs. The rig count has remained stable at 592 for the weeks ending March 7 and March 14, 2025. This indicates a stabilization around the target range of 590-594.\n\n2. **Historical Trends**: The rig count has been fluctuating around the 590-594 range since February 2025, suggesting a stabilization in this range. This is a positive indicator for the probability of the count being within the desired range by March 28, 2025.\n\n3. **Market Influences**: Oil prices have been on a downswing as of January 2025, which could influence drilling activity. A Kansas City Fed survey indicated that a price of $89/barrel is needed for drilling to substantially increase, suggesting current prices may not support a significant rise in rig counts. However, the rig count has remained stable despite these price conditions.\n\n4. **Policy and Regulatory Environment**: President Trump has signed an executive order declaring a national energy emergency to increase oil and gas production, and the administration has issued directives to roll back regulations and accelerate drilling and pipeline development. However, many of these directives face legal challenges, creating uncertainty.\n\n5. **Industry Sentiment**: Executives from Exxon and TotalEnergies have expressed skepticism about increasing production due to a potential oil surplus in 2025, which could lead to throttling new production to avoid price destruction.\n\nGiven the current stabilization of the rig count around 592 and the influence of market and policy factors, the probability of the rig count being between 590 and 594 on March 28, 2025, is relatively high. The current count is already within this range, and there are no strong indicators of significant changes in the immediate future.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.75"
