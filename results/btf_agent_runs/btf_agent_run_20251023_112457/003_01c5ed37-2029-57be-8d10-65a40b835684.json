  "question": "Will the number of active US drilling rigs be 569 or fewer on March 28, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.2,
  "reasoning": "Based on the information gathered, here's a summary of the key points relevant to the forecast:\n\n1. **Current Rig Count**: As of March 14, 2025, the U.S. rig count was 592, unchanged from the previous week. This indicates a relatively stable rig count in recent weeks.\n\n2. **Oil Price Forecast**: The Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts that global oil markets will remain tight through mid-2025, with Brent crude oil prices expected to rise from $70 to $75 per barrel by the third quarter of 2025. However, oil inventories are expected to build later in the year, which could put downward pressure on prices.\n\n3. **Drilling Policy and Market Forces**: The U.S. government, under President Trump, has declared a national energy emergency and is pushing for increased oil and gas production. However, market forces, such as energy prices and legal challenges, may deter companies from significantly increasing drilling activities. Industry leaders like Chevron are increasing production but emphasize the need for policy reforms to streamline permitting processes.\n\n4. **Market Sentiment**: Despite government efforts to boost drilling, there is skepticism about the extent to which companies will ramp up production due to potential market oversupply and the need to maintain shareholder returns.\n\nGiven the current rig count of 592, which is above the threshold of 569, and the stable to slightly increasing trend in rig counts, along with the market and policy environment, it seems unlikely that the rig count will drop to 569 or fewer by March 28, 2025.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.2",

      "content": "---\ntitle: Short-Term Energy Outlook\ndescription: Energy Information Administration - EIA - Official Energy Statistics from the U.S. Government\nsitename: U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)\ndate: 2025-03-14\ncategories: ['official energy statistics, data, analysis and forecasting']\n---\n# Forecast overview\n\n**Global oil markets.**Global oil markets will remain relatively tight through the middle of 2025 before gradually shifting to oil inventory builds later this year. We expect global oil inventories will fall in the second quarter of 2025 (2Q25) in part due to decreasing crude oil production in Iran and Venezuela. As a result, the Brent crude oil spot price in our forecast rises from about $70 per barrel (b) to $75/b by 3Q25. However, we expect oil inventories will build and place downward pressure on crude oil prices in late-2025 and through 2026 when we expect[OPEC+ unwinds production cuts](https://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/press_room/7477.htm)and[non-OPEC oil production grows](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=64565). As a result, we forecast the Brent crude oil price will fall to an average of $68/b in 2026.\n\n**Natural gas consumption and inventories.**Cold weather during January and February led to more consumption of natural gas and large withdrawals of natural gas from inventories. We now expect natural gas inventories to fall below 1.7 trillion cubic feet at the end of March, which is 10% below the previous five-year average and 6% less natural gas in storage than we had expected last month. We also increased our forecast for overall electricity generation over the next two years. As a result, we now expect the electric power sector will use more than 36 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas on average in 2025 and 2026, 2% and 1% more, respectively, than last month. Overall, we expect natural gas in storage to be 4% lower in 2025 and 3% lower in 2026 compared with what we had forecast last month.\n\n**Natural gas prices.**Because we now expect more consumption of natural gas in 2025 and 2026 and less natural gas in storge, we have raised our forecast Henry Hub spot price. We expect the Henry Hub price will average around $4.20 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in 2025, 11% more than last month’s forecast. We expect the annual average price in 2026 will be near $4.50/MMBtu, up 8% from last month.\n\n**Electricity consumption.**We expect total U.S. electricity sales will increase by 3% in 2025, led by strong growth in the residential and commercial sectors. Residential sector growth is mostly related to cold weather during January and February that increased the use of electricity for space heating. Commercial sector growth is being driven by the expansion of data centers.\n\n**Electricity generation.**With more electricity consumption in our forecast this month, we expect the U.S. electric power sector will generate 3% more electricity this year than it did in 2024, compared with forecast growth of 2% last month. We expect electricity generation will grow by another 1% next year. We expect most of the additional generation compared with last month’s forecast will be supplied by natural gas.\n\n**Trade policy assumptions.**The current landscape for U.S. trade policy continues to rapidly evolve. On February 1,[President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.whitehouse.gov%2Ffact-sheets%2F2025%2F02%2Ffact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-imposes-tariffs-on-imports-from-canada-mexico-and-china%2F&data=05%7C02%7CTimothy.Hess%40eia.gov%7Cb2b26d2fac6b493cc9d108dd5fe8db37%7C545f0b0be44040549c17d250cf3556b2%7C0%7C0%7C638772175902099998%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=Yu1Vg2gn2AAI%2FZS7uvJW2Ajv9j2cr4IQK4S4W151IE0%3D&reserved=0)announcing the imposition of tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China. Subsequently, the implementation of tariffs for most imports from Mexico and Canada have been delayed until early April, so the effects of those potential tariffs are not reflected in this outlook. Our outlook does include a tariff on U.S. imports from China and also includes an assumption about China’s imposition in February of[tariffs](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapnews.com%2Farticle%2Fchina-tariffs-us-trump-150fab3a44ec055845e47c82bde544c2&data=05%7C02%7CTimothy.Hess%40eia.gov%7Cb2b26d2fac6b493cc9d108dd5fe8db37%7C545f0b0be44040549c17d250cf3556b2%7C0%7C0%7C638772175902125294%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=56Q2jaEg7s9UzezmIdDcC6xMEN3Ob7I5SMRGY14GVpM%3D&reserved=0)on U.S. energy products. The U.S. macroeconomic outlook we use in the STEO is based on S&P Global’s macroeconomic model, which this month assumed an increasing universal tariff that will reach 10% by the end of 2025 and an effective tariff rate of approximately 20% on U.S. imports from China. That model was released in mid-February and does not reflect current policy. We will continue to monitor and will update our outlooks as policies change.\n\n| Notable Forecast Changes | 2025 | 2026 |\n|---|---|---|\nNote: Values in this table are rounded and may not match values in other tables in this report.

The move was followed by a [directive that aimed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/) to roll back regulations on the oil and gas sector, and accelerate drilling and pipeline development.\n\n“We will drill, baby, drill,” Trump said in his [inauguration speech](https://www.whitehouse.gov/remarks/2025/01/the-inaugural-address/), adding that the US has the “largest amount of oil and gas of any country on Earth — and we are going to use it.”\n\nYet some industry observers have speculated that [energy prices](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/business/energy-environment/oil-trump-drill-baby-drill.html) and [other market forces](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/oil-industry-unlikely-rush-alaska-despite-trumps-call-drill-2025-01-23/) may deter energy companies from increasing drilling, noting that the US has been the world's top [crude oil](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61545) and [liquefied natural gas](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61683) producer for several years now. Moreover, many of the government's directives face [legal challenges](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/environmental-groups-sue-block-trumps-offshore-drilling-expansions-2025-02-19/#:~:text=Feb%2019%20(Reuters)%20%2D%20Environmental,to%20boost%20fossil%20fuel%20production.) from environmental groups and other opponents, creating uncertainty in the sector.\n\nTo better understand how the oil and gas sector is reacting to developments in Washington, we asked Jeff Gustavson, President of Chevron New Energies, about the efforts to scale back regulations and increase production and how the moves might impact market trends and renewable energy advancements.\n\nHere’s what he had to say:\n\n“We believe Chevron’s US production helps power progress. Energy demand is projected to rise from current record highs well into the future. Chevron is responding by increasing our US oil and gas production in ways that are affordable, reliable and ever cleaner. In 2024, Chevron’s US production was ~1.6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of ~19% compared to the year prior.\n\n“Early actions by the Trump administration to streamline permitting are encouraging, but durable policy will require action by Congress. Meaningful permitting reform should be viewed as an enabler of the energy transition to a lower carbon future. An overly burdensome infrastructure permitting process can slow critical energy projects of all types — oil and gas, and renewable infrastructure.\n\n“At Chevron, we continue to support projects that prioritize affordability, reliability and meet environmental standards, this is what is needed to enhance our energy security and advance a lower carbon future.\n\n“We stand ready to continue working with the White House and both parties to achieve comprehensive and meaningful permitting reform that will unlock infrastructure development, support American economic competitiveness and promote energy security for the US and allies.”\n\n##### Don't miss any update on this topic\n\nCreate a free account and access your personalized content collection with our latest publications and analyses.\n\n[Sign up for free](https://www.weforum.org/join-us/individuals)\n\nLicense and Republishing\n\nWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.\n\n##### Stay up to date:\n\n#### United States\n\n##### Related topics:\n\n## Forum Stories newsletter\n\nBringing you weekly curated insights and analysis on the global issues that matter.\n\n### More on Energy Transition[See all](https://www.weforum.org/stories/energy-transition/)\n\n[See all](https://www.weforum.org/stories/energy-transition/)\n\nAndrés Gluski and Christian Bruch\n\nMarch 19, 2025"

We expect global oil inventories will fall in the second quarter of 2025 (2Q25) in part due to decreasing crude oil production in Iran and Venezuela. As a result, the Brent crude oil spot price in our forecast rises from about $70 per barrel (b) to $75/b by 3Q25. However, we expect oil inventories will build and place downward pressure on crude oil prices in late-2025 and through 2026 when we expect[OPEC+ unwinds production cuts](https://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/press_room/7477.htm)and[non-OPEC oil production grows](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=64565). As a result, we forecast the Brent crude oil price will fall to an average of $68/b in 2026.\n\n**Natural gas consumption and inventories.**Cold weather during January and February led to more consumption of natural gas and large withdrawals of natural gas from inventories. We now expect natural gas inventories to fall below 1.7 trillion cubic feet at the end of March, which is 10% below the previous five-year average and 6% less natural gas in storage than we had expected last month. We also increased our forecast for overall electricity generation over the next two years. As a result, we now expect the electric power sector will use more than 36 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas on average in 2025 and 2026, 2% and 1% more, respectively, than last month. Overall, we expect natural gas in storage to be 4% lower in 2025 and 3% lower in 2026 compared with what we had forecast last month.\n\n**Natural gas prices.**Because we now expect more consumption of natural gas in 2025 and 2026 and less natural gas in storge, we have raised our forecast Henry Hub spot price. We expect the Henry Hub price will average around $4.20 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in 2025, 11% more than last month’s forecast. We expect the annual average price in 2026 will be near $4.50/MMBtu, up 8% from last month.\n\n**Electricity consumption.**We expect total U.S. electricity sales will increase by 3% in 2025, led by strong growth in the residential and commercial sectors. Residential sector growth is mostly related to cold weather during January and February that increased the use of electricity for space heating. Commercial sector growth is being driven by the expansion of data centers.\n\n**Electricity generation.**With more electricity consumption in our forecast this month, we expect the U.S. electric power sector will generate 3% more electricity this year than it did in 2024, compared with forecast growth of 2% last month. We expect electricity generation will grow by another 1% next year. We expect most of the additional generation compared with last month’s forecast will be supplied by natural gas.\n\n**Trade policy assumptions.**The current landscape for U.S. trade policy continues to rapidly evolve. On February 1,[President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.whitehouse.gov%2Ffact-sheets%2F2025%2F02%2Ffact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-imposes-tariffs-on-imports-from-canada-mexico-and-china%2F&data=05%7C02%7CTimothy.Hess%40eia.gov%7Cb2b26d2fac6b493cc9d108dd5fe8db37%7C545f0b0be44040549c17d250cf3556b2%7C0%7C0%7C638772175902099998%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=Yu1Vg2gn2AAI%2FZS7uvJW2Ajv9j2cr4IQK4S4W151IE0%3D&reserved=0)announcing the imposition of tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China. Subsequently, the implementation of tariffs for most imports from Mexico and Canada have been delayed until early April, so the effects of those potential tariffs are not reflected in this outlook. Our outlook does include a tariff on U.S. imports from China and also includes an assumption about China’s imposition in February of[tariffs](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapnews.com%2Farticle%2Fchina-tariffs-us-trump-150fab3a44ec055845e47c82bde544c2&data=05%7C02%7CTimothy.Hess%40eia.gov%7Cb2b26d2fac6b493cc9d108dd5fe8db37%7C545f0b0be44040549c17d250cf3556b2%7C0%7C0%7C638772175902125294%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=56Q2jaEg7s9UzezmIdDcC6xMEN3Ob7I5SMRGY14GVpM%3D&reserved=0)on U.S. energy products. The U.S. macroeconomic outlook we use in the STEO is based on S&P Global’s macroeconomic model, which this month assumed an increasing universal tariff that will reach 10% by the end of 2025 and an effective tariff rate of approximately 20% on U.S. imports from China. That model was released in mid-February and does not reflect current policy. We will continue to monitor and will update our outlooks as policies change.\n\n| Notable Forecast Changes | 2025 | 2026 |\n|---|---|---|\nNote: Values in this table are rounded and may not match values in other tables in this report.

The U.S. macroeconomic outlook we use in the STEO is based on S&P Global\\u2019s macroeconomic model, which this month assumed an increasing universal tariff that will reach 10% by the end of 2025 and an effective tariff rate of approximately 20% on U.S. imports from China. That model was released in mid-February and does not reflect current policy. We will continue to monitor and will update our outlooks as policies change.\\n\\n| Notable Forecast Changes | 2025 | 2026 |\\n|---|---|---|\\nNote: Values in this table are rounded and may not match values in other tables in this report.

Additionally, Doug Bergum, Trump's nominee for Secretary of the Interior, [has promised](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/dec/01/doug-burgum-trump-interior-secretary-drilling) to open up federally-protected lands to expedited oil and gas drilling permits.\n\nHowever, OilPrice.com [reports](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Exxon-Pours-Cold-Water-On-Trumps-Drill-Baby-Drill-Plans.html) that it might not be this simple, quoting Exxon’s Upstream President Liam Mallon  and TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanne as saying it is more likely that oil producers, due to a looming surplus of oil in 2025 combined with a need to maximize shareholder returns on capital, may throttle new production in order to avoid price destruction.\n\nAccording to the Financial Times ([‘Drill, baby, drill’ is not so simple](https://www.ft.com/content/90468253-0560-4cb2-a302-2e8636234265)), a key factor will be oil prices. A Kansas City Fed survey of energy firms found that a price of \\$89/barrel was needed for drilling to substantially increase, while oil prices as of January 2025 have been on a downswing:\n\n![Price history](https://metaculus-web-media.s3.amazonaws.com/user_uploaded/Screenshot_2024-12-05_at_2.40.51%C3%A2PM.png)\n\nAccording to Baker Hughes in its recent [annual report](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1701605/000170160524000033/bkr-20231231.htm):\n\n> The Baker Hughes rig counts are an important business barometer for the drilling industry and its suppliers. When drilling rigs are active they consume products and services produced by the oil service industry. Rig count trends are driven by the exploration and development spending by oil and natural gas companies, which in turn is influenced by current and future price expectations for oil and natural gas. The counts may reflect the relative strength and stability of energy prices and overall market activity; however, these counts should not be solely relied on as other specific and pervasive conditions may exist that affect overall energy prices and market activity.\n\n> We have been providing rig counts to the public since 1944. We gather all relevant data through our field service personnel, who obtain the necessary data from routine visits to the various rigs, customers, contractors and other outside sources as necessary. We base the classification of a well as either oil or natural gas primarily upon filings made by operators in the relevant jurisdiction. This data is then compiled and distributed to various wire services and trade associations and is published on our website. We believe the counting process and resulting data is reliable; however, it is subject to our ability to obtain accurate and timely information. Rig counts are compiled weekly for the U.S. and Canada and monthly for all international rigs. Published international rig counts do not include rigs drilling in certain locations, such as onshore China because this information is not readily available.\n\n> Rigs in the U.S. and Canada are counted as active if, on the day the count is taken, the well being drilled has been started but drilling has not been completed and the well is anticipated to be of sufficient depth to be a potential consumer of our drill bits. In international areas, rigs are counted on a weekly basis and deemed active if drilling activities occurred during the majority of the week. The weekly results are then averaged for the month and published accordingly. The rig count does not include rigs that are in transit from one location to another, rigging up, being used in non-drilling activities including production testing, completion and workover, and are not expected to be significant consumers of drill bits.\n\nAccording to the rig count [FAQ](https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/rig-count-faqs), data is published each Friday at noon central US time.

We expect global oil inventories will fall in the second quarter of 2025 (2Q25) in part due to decreasing crude oil production in Iran and Venezuela. As a result, the Brent crude oil spot price in our forecast rises from about $70 per barrel (b) to $75/b by 3Q25. However, we expect oil inventories will build and place downward pressure on crude oil prices in late-2025 and through 2026 when we expect[OPEC+ unwinds production cuts](https://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/press_room/7477.htm)and[non-OPEC oil production grows](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=64565). As a result, we forecast the Brent crude oil price will fall to an average of $68/b in 2026.\\n\\n**Natural gas consumption and inventories.**Cold weather during January and February led to more consumption of natural gas and large withdrawals of natural gas from inventories. We now expect natural gas inventories to fall below 1.7 trillion cubic feet at the end of March, which is 10% below the previous five-year average and 6% less natural gas in storage than we had expected last month. We also increased our forecast for overall electricity generation over the next two years. As a result, we now expect the electric power sector will use more than 36 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas on average in 2025 and 2026, 2% and 1% more, respectively, than last month. Overall, we expect natural gas in storage to be 4% lower in 2025 and 3% lower in 2026 compared with what we had forecast last month.\\n\\n**Natural gas prices.**Because we now expect more consumption of natural gas in 2025 and 2026 and less natural gas in storge, we have raised our forecast Henry Hub spot price. We expect the Henry Hub price will average around $4.20 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in 2025, 11% more than last month\\u2019s forecast. We expect the annual average price in 2026 will be near $4.50/MMBtu, up 8% from last month.\\n\\n**Electricity consumption.**We expect total U.S. electricity sales will increase by 3% in 2025, led by strong growth in the residential and commercial sectors. Residential sector growth is mostly related to cold weather during January and February that increased the use of electricity for space heating. Commercial sector growth is being driven by the expansion of data centers.\\n\\n**Electricity generation.**With more electricity consumption in our forecast this month, we expect the U.S. electric power sector will generate 3% more electricity this year than it did in 2024, compared with forecast growth of 2% last month. We expect electricity generation will grow by another 1% next year. We expect most of the additional generation compared with last month\\u2019s forecast will be supplied by natural gas.\\n\\n**Trade policy assumptions.**The current landscape for U.S. trade policy continues to rapidly evolve. On February 1,[President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.whitehouse.gov%2Ffact-sheets%2F2025%2F02%2Ffact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-imposes-tariffs-on-imports-from-canada-mexico-and-china%2F&data=05%7C02%7CTimothy.Hess%40eia.gov%7Cb2b26d2fac6b493cc9d108dd5fe8db37%7C545f0b0be44040549c17d250cf3556b2%7C0%7C0%7C638772175902099998%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=Yu1Vg2gn2AAI%2FZS7uvJW2Ajv9j2cr4IQK4S4W151IE0%3D&reserved=0)announcing the imposition of tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China. Subsequently, the implementation of tariffs for most imports from Mexico and Canada have been delayed until early April, so the effects of those potential tariffs are not reflected in this outlook. Our outlook does include a tariff on U.S. imports from China and also includes an assumption about China\\u2019s imposition in February of[tariffs](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapnews.com%2Farticle%2Fchina-tariffs-us-trump-150fab3a44ec055845e47c82bde544c2&data=05%7C02%7CTimothy.Hess%40eia.gov%7Cb2b26d2fac6b493cc9d108dd5fe8db37%7C545f0b0be44040549c17d250cf3556b2%7C0%7C0%7C638772175902125294%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=56Q2jaEg7s9UzezmIdDcC6xMEN3Ob7I5SMRGY14GVpM%3D&reserved=0)on U.S. energy products. The U.S. macroeconomic outlook we use in the STEO is based on S&P Global\\u2019s macroeconomic model, which this month assumed an increasing universal tariff that will reach 10% by the end of 2025 and an effective tariff rate of approximately 20% on U.S. imports from China.

Here\\u2019s what a top energy leader has to say\\n\\nUS President Donald Trump signed an executive order declaring a national energy emergency. Image: Unsplash\\n\\n**The United States has vowed to increase oil and gas production.****A shift to renewables and other market forces, however, are also influencing the sector.****We ask Jeff Gustavson, President of Chevron New Energies, about how the industry is reacting.**\\n\\nIn January, on his first day back in the White House, US President Donald Trump signed an [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/declaring-a-national-energy-emergency/) declaring a national energy emergency. The move was followed by a [directive that aimed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/) to roll back regulations on the oil and gas sector, and accelerate drilling and pipeline development.\\n\\n\\u201cWe will drill, baby, drill,\\u201d Trump said in his [inauguration speech](https://www.whitehouse.gov/remarks/2025/01/the-inaugural-address/), adding that the US has the \\u201clargest amount of oil and gas of any country on Earth \\u2014 and we are going to use it.\\u201d\\n\\nYet some industry observers have speculated that [energy prices](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/business/energy-environment/oil-trump-drill-baby-drill.html) and [other market forces](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/oil-industry-unlikely-rush-alaska-despite-trumps-call-drill-2025-01-23/) may deter energy companies from increasing drilling, noting that the US has been the world's top [crude oil](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61545) and [liquefied natural gas](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61683) producer for several years now. Moreover, many of the government's directives face [legal challenges](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/environmental-groups-sue-block-trumps-offshore-drilling-expansions-2025-02-19/#:~:text=Feb%2019%20(Reuters)%20%2D%20Environmental,to%20boost%20fossil%20fuel%20production.) from environmental groups and other opponents, creating uncertainty in the sector.\\n\\nTo better understand how the oil and gas sector is reacting to developments in Washington, we asked Jeff Gustavson, President of Chevron New Energies, about the efforts to scale back regulations and increase production and how the moves might impact market trends and renewable energy advancements.\\n\\nHere\\u2019s what he had to say:\\n\\n\\u201cWe believe Chevron\\u2019s US production helps power progress. Energy demand is projected to rise from current record highs well into the future. Chevron is responding by increasing our US oil and gas production in ways that are affordable, reliable and ever cleaner. In 2024, Chevron\\u2019s US production was ~1.6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of ~19% compared to the year prior.\\n\\n\\u201cEarly actions by the Trump administration to streamline permitting are encouraging, but durable policy will require action by Congress. Meaningful permitting reform should be viewed as an enabler of the energy transition to a lower carbon future. An overly burdensome infrastructure permitting process can slow critical energy projects of all types \\u2014 oil and gas, and renewable infrastructure.\\n\\n\\u201cAt Chevron, we continue to support projects that prioritize affordability, reliability and meet environmental standards, this is what is needed to enhance our energy security and advance a lower carbon future.\\n\\n\\u201cWe stand ready to continue working with the White House and both parties to achieve comprehensive and meaningful permitting reform that will unlock infrastructure development, support American economic competitiveness and promote energy security for the US and allies.\\u201d\\n\\n##### Don't miss any update on this topic\\n\\nCreate a free account and access your personalized content collection with our latest publications and analyses.\\n\\n[Sign up for free](https://www.weforum.org/join-us/individuals)\\n\\nLicense and Republishing\\n\\nWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.\\n\\nThe views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.\\n\\n##### Stay up to date:\\n\\n#### United States\\n\\n##### Related topics:\\n\\n## Forum Stories newsletter\\n\\nBringing you weekly curated insights and analysis on the global issues that matter.\\n\\n### More on Energy Transition[See all](https://www.weforum.org/stories/energy-transition/)\\n\\n[See all](https://www.weforum.org/stories/energy-transition/)\\n\\nAndr\\u00e9s Gluski and Christian Bruch\\n\\nMarch 19, 2025\"}",

      "content": "Based on the information gathered, here's a summary of the key points relevant to the forecast:\n\n1. **Current Rig Count**: As of March 14, 2025, the U.S. rig count was 592, unchanged from the previous week. This indicates a relatively stable rig count in recent weeks.\n\n2. **Oil Price Forecast**: The Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts that global oil markets will remain tight through mid-2025, with Brent crude oil prices expected to rise from $70 to $75 per barrel by the third quarter of 2025. However, oil inventories are expected to build later in the year, which could put downward pressure on prices.\n\n3. **Drilling Policy and Market Forces**: The U.S. government, under President Trump, has declared a national energy emergency and is pushing for increased oil and gas production. However, market forces, such as energy prices and legal challenges, may deter companies from significantly increasing drilling activities. Industry leaders like Chevron are increasing production but emphasize the need for policy reforms to streamline permitting processes.\n\n4. **Market Sentiment**: Despite government efforts to boost drilling, there is skepticism about the extent to which companies will ramp up production due to potential market oversupply and the need to maintain shareholder returns.\n\nGiven the current rig count of 592, which is above the threshold of 569, and the stable to slightly increasing trend in rig counts, along with the market and policy environment, it seems unlikely that the rig count will drop to 569 or fewer by March 28, 2025.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.2"
