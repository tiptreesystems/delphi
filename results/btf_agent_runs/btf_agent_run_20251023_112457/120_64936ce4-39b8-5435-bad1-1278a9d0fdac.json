  "question": "Will the number of active US drilling rigs be 600 or greater on March 28, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.25,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here is the analysis:\n\n1. **Current Rig Count**: As of March 14, 2025, the total number of active US drilling rigs is 592. This count has remained stable for the past two weeks, showing no significant upward trend towards 600 rigs. The rig count has fluctuated slightly in recent weeks but has not reached 600 since early 2024.\n\n2. **Oil Price Forecast**: The Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts that the Brent crude oil spot price will rise from about $70 per barrel to $75 per barrel by the third quarter of 2025. This increase might support drilling activities, but the current price is still below the $89 per barrel threshold identified as necessary for substantial drilling increases.\n\n3. **US Energy Policy**: The Trump administration has issued an executive order to encourage energy exploration and production on Federal lands and waters, potentially leading to increased drilling activity. However, the impact of these policy changes might not be immediate enough to affect the rig count by March 28, 2025.\n\n4. **Market Conditions**: Global oil inventories are expected to fall in the second quarter of 2025, which could support higher oil prices in the short term. However, the overall market conditions, including the need to maximize shareholder returns, may still lead producers to throttle new production.\n\nGiven the current rig count, oil price forecasts, and the potential but not immediate impact of policy changes, the probability of the number of active US drilling rigs reaching 600 or greater by March 28, 2025, appears low.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.25",

We expect global oil inventories will fall in the second quarter of 2025 (2Q25) in part due to decreasing crude oil production in Iran and Venezuela. As a result, the Brent crude oil spot price in our forecast rises from about $70 per barrel (b) to $75/b by 3Q25. However, we expect oil inventories will build and place downward pressure on crude oil prices in late-2025 and through 2026 when we expect[OPEC+ unwinds production cuts](https://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/press_room/7477.htm)and[non-OPEC oil production grows](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=64565). As a result, we forecast the Brent crude oil price will fall to an average of $68/b in 2026.\n\n**Natural gas consumption and inventories.**Cold weather during January and February led to more consumption of natural gas and large withdrawals of natural gas from inventories. We now expect natural gas inventories to fall below 1.7 trillion cubic feet at the end of March, which is 10% below the previous five-year average and 6% less natural gas in storage than we had expected last month. We also increased our forecast for overall electricity generation over the next two years. As a result, we now expect the electric power sector will use more than 36 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas on average in 2025 and 2026, 2% and 1% more, respectively, than last month. Overall, we expect natural gas in storage to be 4% lower in 2025 and 3% lower in 2026 compared with what we had forecast last month.\n\n**Natural gas prices.**Because we now expect more consumption of natural gas in 2025 and 2026 and less natural gas in storge, we have raised our forecast Henry Hub spot price. We expect the Henry Hub price will average around $4.20 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in 2025, 11% more than last month’s forecast. We expect the annual average price in 2026 will be near $4.50/MMBtu, up 8% from last month.\n\n**Electricity consumption.**We expect total U.S. electricity sales will increase by 3% in 2025, led by strong growth in th…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 391 words out of ~901.

Background** .** America is blessed with an abundance of energy and natural resources that have historically powered our Nation’s economic prosperity. In recent years, burdensome and ideologically motivated regulations have impeded the development of these resources, limited the generation of reliable and affordable electricity, reduced job creation, and inflicted high energy costs upon our citizens. These high energy costs devastate American consumers by driving up the cost of transportation, heating, utilities, farming, and manufacturing, while weakening our national security.\n\nIt is thus in the national interest to unleash America’s affordable and reliable energy and natural resources. This will restore American prosperity —- including for those men and women who have been forgotten by our economy in recent years. It will also rebuild our Nation’s economic and military security, which will deliver peace through strength.\n\nSec. 2. Policy.* *It is the policy of the United States:\n\n(a) to encourage energy exploration and production on Federal lands and waters, including on the Outer Continental Shelf, in order to meet the needs of our citizens and solidify the United States as a global energy leader long into the future;\n\n(b) to establish our position as the leading producer and processor of non-fuel minerals, including rare earth minerals, which will create jobs and prosperity at home, strengthen supply chains for the United States and its allies, and reduce the global influence of malign and adversarial states;\n\n(c) to protect the United States’s economic and national security and military preparedness by ensuring that an abundant supply of reliable energy is readily accessible in every State and territory of the Nation;\n\n(d) to ensure that all regulatory requirements related to energy are grounded in clearly applicable law;\n\n(e) to eliminate the “electric vehicle (EV) mandate” and promote true consumer choice, which is essential…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 369 words out of ~3511.

We expect global oil inventories will fall in the second quarter of 2025 (2Q25) in part due to decreasing crude oil production in Iran and Venezuela. As a result, the Brent crude oil spot price in our forecast rises from about $70 per barrel (b) to $75/b by 3Q25. However, we expect oil inventories will build and place downward pressure on crude oil prices in late-2025 and through 2026 when we expect[OPEC+ unwinds production cuts](https://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/press_room/7477.htm)and[non-OPEC oil production grows](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=64565). As a result, we forecast the Brent crude oil price will fall to an average of $68/b in 2026.\n\n**Natural gas consumption and inventories.**Cold weather during January and February led to more consumption of natural gas and large withdrawals of natural gas from inventories. We now expect natural gas inventories to fall below 1.7 trillion cubic feet at the end of March, which is 10% below the previous five-year average and 6% less natural gas in storage than we had expected last month. We also increased our forecast for overall electricity generation over the next two years. As a result, we now expect the electric power sector will use more than 36 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas on average in 2025 and 2026, 2% and 1% more, respectively, than last month. Overall, we expect natural gas in storage to be 4% lower in 2025 and 3% lower in 2026 compared with what we had forecast last month.\n\n**Natural gas prices.**Because we now expect more consumption of natural gas in 2025 and 2026 and less natural gas in storge, we have raised our forecast Henry Hub spot price. We expect the Henry Hub price will average around $4.20 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in 2025, 11% more than last month’s forecast. We expect the annual average price in 2026 will be near $4.50/MMBtu, up 8% from last month.\n\n**Electricity consumption.**We expect total U.S. electricity sales will increase by 3% in 2025, led by strong growth in th…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 391 words out of ~901.

Additionally, Doug Bergum, Trump's nominee for Secretary of the Interior, [has promised](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/dec/01/doug-burgum-trump-interior-secretary-drilling) to open up federally-protected lands to expedited oil and gas drilling permits.\n\nHowever, OilPrice.com [reports](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Exxon-Pours-Cold-Water-On-Trumps-Drill-Baby-Drill-Plans.html) that it might not be this simple, quoting Exxon’s Upstream President Liam Mallon  and TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanne as saying it is more likely that oil producers, due to a looming surplus of oil in 2025 combined with a need to maximize shareholder returns on capital, may throttle new production in order to avoid price destruction.\n\nAccording to the Financial Times ([‘Drill, baby, drill’ is not so simple](https://www.ft.com/content/90468253-0560-4cb2-a302-2e8636234265)), a key factor will be oil prices. A Kansas City Fed survey of energy firms found that a price of \\$89/barrel was needed for drilling to substantially increase, while oil prices as of January 2025 have been on a downswing:\n\n![Price history](https://metaculus-web-media.s3.amazonaws.com/user_uploaded/Screenshot_2024-12-05_at_2.40.51%C3%A2PM.png)\n\nAccording to Baker Hughes in its recent [annual report](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1701605/000170160524000033/bkr-20231231.htm):\n\n> The Baker Hughes rig counts are an important business barometer for the drilling industry and its suppliers. When drilling rigs are active they consume products and services produced by the oil service industry. Rig count trends are driven by the exploration and development spending by oil and natural gas companies, which in turn is influenced by current and future price expectations for oil and natural gas. The counts may reflect the relative strength and stability of energy prices and overall market activity; however, these counts should not be solely relied on as other specific and pervasive conditions may exist that affect overall energy prices and market activity.\n\n> We have been providing rig counts to the public since 1944. We gather all relevant data through our field service personnel, who obtain the necessary data from routine visits to the various rigs, customers, contractors and other outside sources as necessary. We base the classification of a well as either oil or natural gas primarily upon filings made by operators in the relevant jurisdiction. This data is then compiled and distributed to various wire services and trade associations and is published on our website. We believe the counting process and resulting data is reliable; however, it is subject to our ability to obtain accurate and timely information. Rig counts are compiled weekly for the U.S. and Canada and monthly for all international rigs. Published international rig counts do not include rigs drilling in certain locations, such as onshore China because this information is not readily available.\n\n> Rigs in the U.S. and Canada are counted as active if, on the day the count is taken, the well being drilled has been started but drilling has not been completed and the well is anticipated to be of sufficient depth to be a potential consumer of our drill bits. In international areas, rigs are counted on a weekly basis and deemed active if drilling activities occurred during the majority of the week. The weekly results are then averaged for the month and published accordingly. The rig count does not include rigs that are in transit from one location to another, rigging up, being used in non-drilling activities including production testing, completion and workover, and are not expected to be significant consumers of drill bits.\n\nAccording to the rig count [FAQ](https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/rig-count-faqs), data is published each Friday at noon central US time. Recent reports have found the following rig count numbers:\n\n| Date               | Value | Date              | Value |\n| ------------------ | ----- | ----------------- | ----- |\n| January 31, 2025   | 582   | July 5, 2024      | 585   |\n| January 24, 2025   | 576   | June 28, 2024     | 581   |\n| January 17, 2025   | 580   | June 21, 2024     | 588   |\n| January 10, 2025   | 584   | June 14, 2024     | 590   |\n| January 3, 2025    | 589   | June 7, 2024      | 594   |\n| December 27, 2024  | 589   | May 31, 2024      | 600   |\n| December 20, 2024  | 589   | May 24, 2024      | 600   |\n| December 13, 2024  | 589   | May 17, 2024      | 604   |\n| December 6, 2024   | 589   | May 10, 2024      | 603   |\n| November 27, 2024  | 582   | May 3, 2024       | 605   |\n| November 22, 2024  | 583   | April 26, 2024    | 613   |\n| November 15, 2024  | 584   | April 19, 2024    | 619   |\n| November 8, 2024   | 585   | April 12, 2024    | 617   |\n| November 1, 2024   | 585   | April 5, 2024     | 620   |\n| October 25, 2024   | 585   | March 28, 2024    | 621   |\n| October 18, 2024   | 585   | March 22, 2024    | 624   |\n| October 11, 2024   | 586   | March 15, 2024    | 629   |\n| October 4, 2024    | 585   | March 8, 2024     | 622   |\n| September 27, 2024 | 587   | March 1, 2024     | 629   |\n| September 20, 2024 | 588   | February 23, 2024 | 626   |\n| September 13, 2024 | 590   | February 16, 2024 | 621   |\n| September 6, 2024  | 582   | February 9, 2024  | 623   |\n| August 30, 2024    | 583   | February 2, 2024  | 619   |\n| August 23, 2024    | 585   | January 26, 2024  | 621   |\n| August 16, 2024    | 586   | January 19, 2024  | 620   |\n| August 9, 2024     | 588   | January 12, 2024  | 619   |\n| August 2, 2024     | 586   | January 5, 2024   | 621   |\n| July 26, 2024      | 589   | December 29, 2023 | 622   |\n| July 19, 2024      | 586   | December 21, 2023 | 620   |\n| July 12, 2024      | 584   |                   |       |\nResolution criteria: This question resolves as YES if the last count of active US drilling rigs for the week ending March 28, 2025, according to the Baker Hughes North America Rig Count, is 600 or higher.

We expect the Henry Hub price will average around $4.20 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in 2025, 11% more than last months forecast. We expect the annual average price in 2026 will be near $4.50/MMBtu, up 8% from last month.\\n\\n**Electricity consumption.**We expect total U.S. electricity sales will increase by 3% in 2025, led by strong growth in th\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 391 words out of ~901.

Background** .** America is blessed with an abundance of energy and natural resources that have historically powered our Nations economic prosperity. In recent years, burdensome and ideologically motivated regulations have impeded the development of these resources, limited the generation of reliable and affordable electricity, reduced job creation, and inflicted high energy costs upon our citizens. These high energy costs devastate American consumers by driving up the cost of transportation, heating, utilities, farming, and manufacturing, while weakening our national security.\\n\\nIt is thus in the national interest to unleash Americas affordable and reliable energy and natural resources. This will restore American prosperity  including for those men and women who have been forgotten by our economy in recent years. It will also rebuild our Nations economic and military security, which will deliver peace through strength.\\n\\nSec. 2. Policy.* *It is the policy of the United States:\\n\\n(a) to encourage energy exploration and production on Federal lands and waters, including on the Outer Continental Shelf, in order to meet the needs of our citizens and solidify the United States as a global energy leader long into the future;\\n\\n(b) to establish our position as the leading producer and processor of non-fuel minerals, including rare earth minerals, which will create jobs and prosperity at home, strengthen supply chains for the United States and its allies, and reduce the global influence of malign and adversarial states;\\n\\n(c) to protect the United Statess economic and national security and military preparedness by ensuring that an abundant supply of reliable energy is readily accessible in every State and territory of the Nation;\\n\\n(d) to ensure that all regulatory requirements related to energy are grounded in clearly applicable law;\\n\\n(e) to eliminate the electric vehicle (EV) mandate and promote true consumer choice, which is essential\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 369 words out of ~3511.

      "content": "Based on the gathered evidence, here is the analysis:\n\n1. **Current Rig Count**: As of March 14, 2025, the total number of active US drilling rigs is 592. This count has remained stable for the past two weeks, showing no significant upward trend towards 600 rigs. The rig count has fluctuated slightly in recent weeks but has not reached 600 since early 2024.\n\n2. **Oil Price Forecast**: The Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts that the Brent crude oil spot price will rise from about $70 per barrel to $75 per barrel by the third quarter of 2025. This increase might support drilling activities, but the current price is still below the $89 per barrel threshold identified as necessary for substantial drilling increases.\n\n3. **US Energy Policy**: The Trump administration has issued an executive order to encourage energy exploration and production on Federal lands and waters, potentially leading to increased drilling activity. However, the impact of these policy changes might not be immediate enough to affect the rig count by March 28, 2025.\n\n4. **Market Conditions**: Global oil inventories are expected to fall in the second quarter of 2025, which could support higher oil prices in the short term. However, the overall market conditions, including the need to maximize shareholder returns, may still lead producers to throttle new production.\n\nGiven the current rig count, oil price forecasts, and the potential but not immediate impact of policy changes, the probability of the number of active US drilling rigs reaching 600 or greater by March 28, 2025, appears low.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.25"
