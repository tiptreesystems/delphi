  "question": "Will the DOGE Live Tracker report Savings Per Taxpayer less than $500.00 on March 31, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.85,
  "reasoning": "Based on the information gathered, here's the analysis:\n\n1. **DOGE Savings Claims**: As of early March 2025, DOGE claims to have saved $105 billion. However, these claims are widely criticized for being inflated and not supported by verifiable data. The Musk Watch DOGE Tracker suggests that the verifiable savings are much lower, around $8.6 billion.\n\n2. **Savings Per Taxpayer**: The DOGE Live Tracker reports that only 5.75% of the $2 trillion savings goal has been achieved. This suggests that the savings per taxpayer is likely to be significantly below the $500 mark, given the ambitious goal and the current progress.\n\n3. **Criticism and Skepticism**: There is significant skepticism about the actual impact of DOGE's claimed savings. Many of the savings are not legally binding reductions in the federal budget, and the methodology for calculating savings is criticized for using inflated figures.\n\n4. **Current Savings Pace**: DOGE's current savings pace is less than half of what is needed to meet its stated goal of cutting $1 trillion by the end of September 2025. This further indicates that the savings per taxpayer is unlikely to reach $500 by March 31, 2025.\n\nConsidering these points, the probability that the DOGE Live Tracker will report savings per taxpayer less than $500 on March 31, 2025, is high.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.85",

In an appearance on Fox Business this week, Musk claimed he was saving $4 billion per day and was on track to cut $1 trillion from the federal budget.\n\nIs that true?\n\nMusk claims to operate with unprecedented transparency and has posted \"receipts\" for the savings on DOGE.gov.\n\nMost of these purported \"savings,\" however, are not backed up with any details or documentation. In other cases, DOGE has provided documentation, but the documents reveal that DOGE has grossly overstated the potential savings to taxpayers.\n\nThat is why, today, we are launching the [Musk Watch DOGE Tracker](http://doge.muskwatch.com). The Musk Watch DOGE Tracker allows anyone to easily cut through the spin about DOGE and see how much savings can be verified. It also allows the public to go deeper and see what is being cut and who is being impacted. It will be updated weekly.\n\nThe [Musk Watch DOGE Tracker](https://doge.muskwatch.com) breaks down the purported savings into three categories:\n\n**1. DOGE Claimed Total Savings ($105 billion)**\n\nThis is just the number at the top of the DOGE website. It is the number used by Musk and Trump in media appearances and, too often, is uncritically repeated in the media. As of March 12, DOGE claims $105 billion in total savings. There is no relationship between this number and the actual data on the rest of the website.\n\n**2. DOGE Itemized Savings ($29.9 billion)**\n\nThis includes the total amount of claimed savings where DOGE provides any itemization, whether the information is accurate or verifiable. It currently includes around $14.5 billion in grants where the only information provided is the federal department and the dollar amount. The lack of information means these savings cannot be verified.\n\nThis category also includes the claimed savings for all canceled contracts, even though these savings are frequently inflated.

But it's not looking at big spending drivers\n\nElon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency have an ambitious goal of cutting $1 trillion in federal spending by the end of the fiscal year in September.\n\nBut DOGE's moves so far to cancel contracts, end leases and push federal agencies to reduce their workforces barely make a dent in the government's overall balance sheet — even if you take DOGE's savings claims at face value.\n\nAnd as [NPR has reported](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/01/nx-s1-5313853/doge-savings-receipts-musk-trump), those early DOGE savings claims have been inaccurate and drastically overstated.\n\nIn Congress, where decisions about trillions of dollars in spending are debated and authorized in appropriations bills, House Republicans have [approved a framework](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/25/nx-s1-5308067/house-republicans-budget-vote-mike-johnson) that would include $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and a goal of $2 trillion in spending cuts. There are several more steps until legislation like that could get final approval.\n\nIt's through congressional action, not DOGE, where any changes to spending and revenue collection would happen at a meaningful scale, said Jessica Riedl of the center-right Manhattan Institute.\n\n\"Think of Congress and its budget as the debt-ridden dad on the way to buy a $250,000 Ferrari on the credit card, and DOGE is the $2-off gas card he used along the way,\" Riedl said. \"It's great that he saved $2 on gas, but I think his wife may be more concerned about the $250,000 car.\"\n\n### DOGE's alleged savings are a drop in the budget bucket\n\nFor every dollar that the federal government has spent so far since the start of this fiscal year in October 2024, DOGE — which began operating in mid-January — has claimed to save the equivalent of about four pennies.\n\nFrom Oct. 1, 2024, through Jan. 31, 2025, the federal government collected [$1.6 trillion](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/governmen…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 366 words out of ~905.

But it's not looking at big spending drivers\n\nElon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency have an ambitious goal of cutting $1 trillion in federal spending by the end of the fiscal year in September.\n\nBut DOGE's moves so far to cancel contracts, end leases and push federal agencies to reduce their workforces barely make a dent in the government's overall balance sheet — even if you take DOGE's savings claims at face value.\n\nAnd as [NPR has reported](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/01/nx-s1-5313853/doge-savings-receipts-musk-trump), those early DOGE savings claims have been inaccurate and drastically overstated.\n\nIn Congress, where decisions about trillions of dollars in spending are debated and authorized in appropriations bills, House Republicans have [approved a framework](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/25/nx-s1-5308067/house-republicans-budget-vote-mike-johnson) that would include $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and a goal of $2 trillion in spending cuts. There are several more steps until legislation like that could get final approval.\n\nIt's through congressional action, not DOGE, where any changes to spending and revenue collection would happen at a meaningful scale, said Jessica Riedl of the center-right Manhattan Institute.\n\n\"Think of Congress and its budget as the debt-ridden dad on the way to buy a $250,000 Ferrari on the credit card, and DOGE is the $2-off gas card he used along the way,\" Riedl said. \"It's great that he saved $2 on gas, but I think his wife may be more concerned about the $250,000 car.\"\n\n### DOGE's alleged savings are a drop in the budget bucket\n\nFor every dollar that the federal government has spent so far since the start of this fiscal year in October 2024, DOGE — which began operating in mid-January — has claimed to save the equivalent of about four pennies.\n\nFrom Oct. 1, 2024, through Jan. 31, 2025, the federal government collected [$1.6 trillion](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/governmen…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 366 words out of ~905.

There are several more steps until legislation like that could get final approval.\\n\\nIt's through congressional action, not DOGE, where any changes to spending and revenue collection would happen at a meaningful scale, said Jessica Riedl of the center-right Manhattan Institute.\\n\\n\\\"Think of Congress and its budget as the debt-ridden dad on the way to buy a $250,000 Ferrari on the credit card, and DOGE is the $2-off gas card he used along the way,\\\" Riedl said. \\\"It's great that he saved $2 on gas, but I think his wife may be more concerned about the $250,000 car.\\\"\\n\\n### DOGE's alleged savings are a drop in the budget bucket\\n\\nFor every dollar that the federal government has spent so far since the start of this fiscal year in October 2024, DOGE \\u2014 which began operating in mid-January \\u2014 has claimed to save the equivalent of about four pennies.\\n\\nFrom Oct. 1, 2024, through Jan. 31, 2025, the federal government collected [$1.6 trillion](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/governmen\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 366 words out of ~905.

In an appearance on Fox Business this week, Musk claimed he was saving $4 billion per day and was on track to cut $1 trillion from the federal budget.\\n\\nIs that true?\\n\\nMusk claims to operate with unprecedented transparency and has posted \\\"receipts\\\" for the savings on DOGE.gov.\\n\\nMost of these purported \\\"savings,\\\" however, are not backed up with any details or documentation. In other cases, DOGE has provided documentation, but the documents reveal that DOGE has grossly overstated the potential savings to taxpayers.\\n\\nThat is why, today, we are launching the [Musk Watch DOGE Tracker](http://doge.muskwatch.com). The Musk Watch DOGE Tracker allows anyone to easily cut through the spin about DOGE and see how much savings can be verified. It also allows the public to go deeper and see what is being cut and who is being impacted. It will be updated weekly.\\n\\nThe [Musk Watch DOGE Tracker](https://doge.muskwatch.com) breaks down the purported savings into three categories:\\n\\n**1. DOGE Claimed Total Savings ($105 billion)**\\n\\nThis is just the number at the top of the DOGE website. It is the number used by Musk and Trump in media appearances and, too often, is uncritically repeated in the media. As of March 12, DOGE claims $105 billion in total savings. There is no relationship between this number and the actual data on the rest of the website.\\n\\n**2. DOGE Itemized Savings ($29.9 billion)**\\n\\nThis includes the total amount of claimed savings where DOGE provides any itemization, whether the information is accurate or verifiable. It currently includes around $14.5 billion in grants where the only information provided is the federal department and the dollar amount. The lack of information means these savings cannot be verified.\\n\\nThis category also includes the claimed savings for all canceled contracts, even though these savings are frequently inflated.

But it's not looking at big spending drivers\\n\\nElon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency have an ambitious goal of cutting $1 trillion in federal spending by the end of the fiscal year in September.\\n\\nBut DOGE's moves so far to cancel contracts, end leases and push federal agencies to reduce their workforces barely make a dent in the government's overall balance sheet \\u2014 even if you take DOGE's savings claims at face value.\\n\\nAnd as [NPR has reported](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/01/nx-s1-5313853/doge-savings-receipts-musk-trump), those early DOGE savings claims have been inaccurate and drastically overstated.\\n\\nIn Congress, where decisions about trillions of dollars in spending are debated and authorized in appropriations bills, House Republicans have [approved a framework](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/25/nx-s1-5308067/house-republicans-budget-vote-mike-johnson) that would include $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and a goal of $2 trillion in spending cuts. There are several more steps until legislation like that could get final approval.\\n\\nIt's through congressional action, not DOGE, where any changes to spending and revenue collection would happen at a meaningful scale, said Jessica Riedl of the center-right Manhattan Institute.\\n\\n\\\"Think of Congress and its budget as the debt-ridden dad on the way to buy a $250,000 Ferrari on the credit card, and DOGE is the $2-off gas card he used along the way,\\\" Riedl said. \\\"It's great that he saved $2 on gas, but I think his wife may be more concerned about the $250,000 car.\\\"\\n\\n### DOGE's alleged savings are a drop in the budget bucket\\n\\nFor every dollar that the federal government has spent so far since the start of this fiscal year in October 2024, DOGE \\u2014 which began operating in mid-January \\u2014 has claimed to save the equivalent of about four pennies.\\n\\nFrom Oct. 1, 2024, through Jan. 31, 2025, the federal government collected [$1.6 trillion](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/governmen\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 366 words out of ~905.

This suggests that the savings per taxpayer is likely to be significantly below the $500 mark, given the ambitious goal and the current progress.\n\n3. **Criticism and Skepticism**: There is significant skepticism about the actual impact of DOGE's claimed savings. Many of the savings are not legally binding reductions in the federal budget, and the methodology for calculating savings is criticized for using inflated figures.\n\n4. **Current Savings Pace**: DOGE's current savings pace is less than half of what is needed to meet its stated goal of cutting $1 trillion by the end of September 2025. This further indicates that the savings per taxpayer is unlikely to reach $500 by March 31, 2025.\n\nConsidering these points, the probability that the DOGE Live Tracker will report savings per taxpayer less than $500 on March 31, 2025, is high.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.85"
