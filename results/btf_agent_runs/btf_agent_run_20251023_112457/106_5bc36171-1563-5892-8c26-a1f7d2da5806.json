  "question": "Will the total number of likes made on Bluesky on March 30, 2025 be less than 20 million?",
  "probability": 0.3,
  "reasoning": "Based on the information gathered, here are some key insights:\n\n1. **User Growth and Engagement**: As of March 2025, Bluesky has over 33 million users, which is a significant increase from 13 million in late October 2024. This rapid growth suggests a high potential for user activity, including likes.\n\n2. **Daily Active Users**: The platform has around 3.5 million daily active users in the US and UK, which indicates a substantial level of daily engagement.\n\n3. **Likes and Engagement Trends**: The platform recorded a total of 4.698 billion likes as of the latest available data. Additionally, there was a surge in user engagement in November 2024, with some organizations reporting a 2x to 10x increase in engagement.\n\n4. **Content Creation**: Around 1.18 million posts have been made on Bluesky as of March 2025, equating to 35 posts per user, indicating active content creation which could lead to more likes.\n\n5. **User Activity**: The average Bluesky user visits approximately 8 pages per session, suggesting moderate user engagement.\n\nGiven the rapid growth in user numbers and the high level of engagement, it seems likely that the number of likes on March 30, 2025, could be substantial. However, predicting whether it will exceed 20 million on a single day requires more specific data on daily likes trends, which is not available.\n\nConsidering the available data and the upward trends, I estimate the probability that the total number of likes made on Bluesky on March 30, 2025, will be less than 20 million is relatively low.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.3",

The\nsitename: Proxidize\ndate: 2025-01-30\n---\nThe Bluesky user count has soared to over 25 million users as of December 2024, reflecting a remarkable surge from 13 million just two months earlier. The platform is currently growing at a rate of 5.4 users per second and is attracting approximately 466,500 new users daily.\n\nThis influx underscores Bluesky’s rapid expansion, especially among younger audiences where 42% of the user base is between 18-24. Brazil alone accounts for 37.7% of traffic, with the United States following at 25.6%.\n\nIn this article, we’ll examine Bluesky’s explosive growth, explore its user demographics, and discuss the key statistics that illustrate its emergence as a formidable social media platform.\n\n**What Is Bluesky?**\n\nBluesky takes a novel approach to social networking by functioning as a decentralized platform built on the AT Protocol. The project is open-source, giving anyone transparent insight into its design. Users can share 300-character text messages, images, and videos, all while controlling the nature of their feeds.\n\nBut how exactly does Bluesky differentiate itself? One answer is its “marketplace of algorithms” that lets users choose or create custom feeds based on preferences. With over 50k custom feeds available, Bluesky offers a unique degree of flexibility in shaping one’s experience. The platform also includes user-managed moderation and labeling services, plus user-made “starter packs” that help newcomers jump in with relevant communities.\n\nIn terms of corporate identity, Bluesky operates as a Public Benefit Corporation, with ownership primarily held by CEO Jay Graber and the Bluesky team. They are supported by a board that features notable innovators like Jeremie Miller (inventor of Jabber/XMPP), Mike Masnick, and Kinjal Shah. This structure preserves the platform’s focus on growing and promoting open-source technology for decentralized public conversation.\n\nBluesky’s handle system is another hallmark. Instead of relying on standard “checkmarks,” the platform uses domain name-based handles that require users to prove domain ownership. This approach aims to preserve authenticity and give cre…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 365 words out of ~1691. Full content available via `btf_extract_evidence`.]"

The platform is currently growing at a rate of 5.4 users per second and is attracting approximately 466,500 new users daily.\\n\\nThis influx underscores Bluesky\\u2019s rapid expansion, especially among younger audiences where 42% of the user base is between 18-24. Brazil alone accounts for 37.7% of traffic, with the United States following at 25.6%.\\n\\nIn this article, we\\u2019ll examine Bluesky\\u2019s explosive growth, explore its user demographics, and discuss the key statistics that illustrate its emergence as a formidable social media platform.\\n\\n**What Is Bluesky?**\\n\\nBluesky takes a novel approach to social networking by functioning as a decentralized platform built on the AT Protocol. The project is open-source, giving anyone transparent insight into its design. Users can share 300-character text messages, images, and videos, all while controlling the nature of their feeds.\\n\\nBut how exactly does Bluesky differentiate itself? One answer is its \\u201cmarketplace of algorithms\\u201d that lets users choose or create custom feeds based on preferences. With over 50k custom feeds available, Bluesky offers a unique degree of flexibility in shaping one\\u2019s experience. The platform also includes user-managed moderation and labeling services, plus user-made \\u201cstarter packs\\u201d that help newcomers jump in with relevant communities.\\n\\nIn terms of corporate identity, Bluesky operates as a Public Benefit Corporation, with ownership primarily held by CEO Jay Graber and the Bluesky team. They are supported by a board that features notable innovators like Jeremie Miller (inventor of Jabber/XMPP), Mike Masnick, and Kinjal Shah. This structure preserves the platform\\u2019s focus on growing and promoting open-source technology for decentralized public conversation.\\n\\nBluesky\\u2019s handle system is another hallmark. Instead of relying on standard \\u201ccheckmarks,\\u201d the platform uses domain name-based handles that require users to prove domain ownership. This approach aims to preserve authenticity and give cre\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 365 words out of ~1691.

This rapid growth suggests a high potential for user activity, including likes.\n\n2. **Daily Active Users**: The platform has around 3.5 million daily active users in the US and UK, which indicates a substantial level of daily engagement.\n\n3. **Likes and Engagement Trends**: The platform recorded a total of 4.698 billion likes as of the latest available data. Additionally, there was a surge in user engagement in November 2024, with some organizations reporting a 2x to 10x increase in engagement.\n\n4. **Content Creation**: Around 1.18 million posts have been made on Bluesky as of March 2025, equating to 35 posts per user, indicating active content creation which could lead to more likes.\n\n5. **User Activity**: The average Bluesky user visits approximately 8 pages per session, suggesting moderate user engagement.\n\nGiven the rapid growth in user numbers and the high level of engagement, it seems likely that the number of likes on March 30, 2025, could be substantial. However, predicting whether it will exceed 20 million on a single day requires more specific data on daily likes trends, which is not available.\n\nConsidering the available data and the upward trends, I estimate the probability that the total number of likes made on Bluesky on March 30, 2025, will be less than 20 million is relatively low.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.3"
