  "question": "Will the Warren Buffett Indicator (Wilshire 5000 to GDP Ratio) be less than 180.0% on March 28, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.1,
  "reasoning": "Based on the information gathered, here are the key points relevant to the question:\n\n1. **Current Buffett Indicator Value**: As of March 17, 2025, the Market Cap to GDP Ratio (Buffett Indicator) is reported to be 192.8% according to GuruFocus. This is significantly above the 180% threshold specified in the question.\n\n2. **Historical Context**: The Buffett Indicator has reached a record high of 209.7% and a record low of 31.2%, with a median value of 88.6%. The typical value range is from 124% to 180%.\n\n3. **Economic Trends**: The US GDP growth rate has been slowing, with a 2.3% increase in the fourth quarter of 2024. The economic outlook for early 2025 suggests weaker growth, which might not be sufficient to significantly reduce the Buffett Indicator below 180% by March 28, 2025.\n\nGiven the current value of the Buffett Indicator at 192.8%, which is above the 180% threshold, and the economic trends indicating slower growth, it seems unlikely that the Buffett Indicator will fall below 180% by March 28, 2025.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1",

The current ratio of 211% is approximately 66.99% (or about 2.2 standard deviations) above the historical trend line, suggesting that the stock market is Strongly Overvalued relative to GDP.\n\n#### Why Does it Matter?\n\nThe Buffett Indicator expresses the value of the US stock market in terms of the size of the US economy. If the stock market value is growing much faster than the actual economy, then it may be in a bubble.\n\nFor much more analysis and information on the data sources, methodology, and counterpoints to this model, continue reading.\n\n\n## Theory & Data\n\nThe Buffett Indicator is the ratio of total US stock market value divided by GDP. Named after Warren Buffett, who called the ratio \"the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment\". (Buffett has since walked back those comments, hesitating to endorse any single measure as either comprehensive or consistent over time, but this ratio remains credited to his name). To calculate the ratio, we need to get data for both metrics: Total Market Value and GDP.\n\n##### Total Market Value\n\nThe most common measurement of the aggregate value of the US stock market is the Wilshire 5000. This is available directly from Wilshire (links to all data sources [below](https://www.currentmarketvaluation.com#data-sources-section)), with monthly data starting in 1971, and daily measures beginning in 1980. The Wilshire index was created such that a 1-point increase in the index corresponds to a $1 billion increase…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 376 words out of ~1864.

The ratio has certain limitations in telling you what you need to know. Still, it is probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment. And as you can see, nearly two years ago the ratio rose to an unprecedented level. That should have been a very strong warning signal. For investors to gain wealth at a rate that exceeds the growth of U.S. business, the percentage relationship line on the chart must keep going up and up. If GNP is going to grow 5% a year and you want market values to go up 10%, then you need to have the line go straight off the top of the chart. That won't happen. For me, the message of that chart is this: If the percentage relationship falls to the 70% or 80% area, buying stocks is likely to work very well for you. If the ratio approaches 200%--as it did in 1999 and a part of 2000--you are playing with fire. As you can see, the ratio was recently 133%.\"\nResolution criteria: This question resolves as YES if the Warren Buffett Indicator (Wilshire 5000 to GDP Ratio) is less than 180.0% on March 28, 2025, as reported at the [Longtermtrends website](https://www.longtermtrends.net/market-cap-to-gdp-the-buffett-indicator/).

The current ratio of 211% is approximately 66.99% (or about 2.2 standard deviations) above the historical trend line, suggesting that the stock market is Strongly Overvalued relative to GDP.\\n\\n#### Why Does it Matter?\\n\\nThe Buffett Indicator expresses the value of the US stock market in terms of the size of the US economy. If the stock market value is growing much faster than the actual economy, then it may be in a bubble.\\n\\nFor much more analysis and information on the data sources, methodology, and counterpoints to this model, continue reading.\\n\\n\\n## Theory & Data\\n\\nThe Buffett Indicator is the ratio of total US stock market value divided by GDP. Named after Warren Buffett, who called the ratio \\\"the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment\\\". (Buffett has since walked back those comments, hesitating to endorse any single measure as either comprehensive or consistent over time, but this ratio remains credited to his name). To calculate the ratio, we need to get data for both metrics: Total Market Value and GDP.\\n\\n##### Total Market Value\\n\\nThe most common measurement of the aggregate value of the US stock market is the Wilshire 5000. This is available directly from Wilshire (links to all data sources [below](https://www.currentmarketvaluation.com#data-sources-section)), with monthly data starting in 1971, and daily measures beginning in 1980. The Wilshire index was created such that a 1-point increase in the index corresponds to a $1 billion increase\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 376 words out of ~1864.

The ratio has certain limitations in telling you what you need to know. Still, it is probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment. And as you can see, nearly two years ago the ratio rose to an unprecedented level. That should have been a very strong warning signal. For investors to gain wealth at a rate that exceeds the growth of U.S. business, the percentage relationship line on the chart must keep going up and up. If GNP is going to grow 5% a year and you want market values to go up 10%, then you need to have the line go straight off the top of the chart. That won't happen. For me, the message of that chart is this: If the percentage relationship falls to the 70% or 80% area, buying stocks is likely to work very well for you. If the ratio approaches 200%--as it did in 1999 and a part of 2000--you are playing with fire. As you can see, the ratio was recently 133%.\\\"\",\"resolution_criteria\":\"This question resolves as YES if the Warren Buffett Indicator (Wilshire 5000 to GDP Ratio) is less than 180.0% on March 28, 2025, as reported at the Longtermtrends website. The figures can be viewed either on the chart itself or by viewing the CSV, XLX, or data table.\",\"fine_print\":\"This resolves based on UTC time. Note that this means if one is in a UTC minus time zone (such as anywhere in the Western Hemisphere; e.g., the Eastern Time Zone, which is 4 or 5 hours behind UTC), the site may display one day sooner. So for example March 28, 2025 in UTC may display as March 27, 2025 for those in such time zones.\",\"present_date\":\"2025-03-21T16:55:14.548598\"}"

      "content": "Based on the information gathered, here are the key points relevant to the question:\n\n1. **Current Buffett Indicator Value**: As of March 17, 2025, the Market Cap to GDP Ratio (Buffett Indicator) is reported to be 192.8% according to GuruFocus. This is significantly above the 180% threshold specified in the question.\n\n2. **Historical Context**: The Buffett Indicator has reached a record high of 209.7% and a record low of 31.2%, with a median value of 88.6%. The typical value range is from 124% to 180%.\n\n3. **Economic Trends**: The US GDP growth rate has been slowing, with a 2.3% increase in the fourth quarter of 2024. The economic outlook for early 2025 suggests weaker growth, which might not be sufficient to significantly reduce the Buffett Indicator below 180% by March 28, 2025.\n\nGiven the current value of the Buffett Indicator at 192.8%, which is above the 180% threshold, and the economic trends indicating slower growth, it seems unlikely that the Buffett Indicator will fall below 180% by March 28, 2025.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1"
