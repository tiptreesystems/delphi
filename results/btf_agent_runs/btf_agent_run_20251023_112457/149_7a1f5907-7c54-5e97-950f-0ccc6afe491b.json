  "question": "Will the Warren Buffett Indicator (Wilshire 5000 to GDP Ratio) be greater than 210.0% on March 28, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.85,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here are the key points relevant to estimating the probability of the Warren Buffett Indicator (Wilshire 5000 to GDP Ratio) being greater than 210.0% on March 28, 2025:\n\n1. **Current Value**: As of December 31, 2024, the Buffett Indicator was at 211%. This value is already above the threshold of 210.0%.\n\n2. **Historical Context**: The current value of 211% is approximately 66.99% above its historical trend line, indicating that the market is strongly overvalued. Historically, such high values have been associated with market bubbles, such as during the Dot-com bubble of 2000.\n\n3. **Economic Projections**: The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) projects real GDP growth for 2025 to be between 1.5% and 1.9%, with a median of 1.7%. This suggests modest economic growth, which may not significantly alter the GDP component of the ratio.\n\n4. **Market Conditions**: Given the current overvaluation and the lack of significant economic shocks expected according to the FOMC's projections, it is plausible that the stock market valuation relative to GDP could remain elevated in the short term.\n\nConsidering these factors, the probability that the Warren Buffett Indicator will remain above 210.0% on March 28, 2025, is quite high, given that it is already at 211% and economic conditions do not suggest a rapid change.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.85",

The current ratio of 211% is approximately 66.99% (or about 2.2 standard deviations) above the historical trend line, suggesting that the stock market is Strongly Overvalued relative to GDP.\n\n#### Why Does it Matter?\n\nThe Buffett Indicator expresses the value of the US stock market in terms of the size of the US economy. If the stock market value is growing much faster than the actual economy, then it may be in a bubble.\n\nFor much more analysis and information on the data sources, methodology, and counterpoints to this model, continue reading.\n\n\n## Theory & Data\n\nThe Buffett Indicator is the ratio of total US stock market value divided by GDP. Named after Warren Buffett, who called the ratio \"the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment\". (Buffett has since walked back those comments, hesitating to endorse any single measure as either comprehensive or consistent over time, but this ratio remains credited to his name). To calculate the ratio, we need to get data for both metrics: Total Market Value and GDP.\n\n##### Total Market Value\n\nThe most common measurement of the aggregate value of the US stock market is the Wilshire 5000. This is available directly from Wilshire (links to all data sources [below](https://www.currentmarketvaluation.com#data-sources-section)), with monthly data starting in 1971, and daily measures beginning in 1980. The Wilshire index was created such that a 1-point increase in the index corresponds to a $1 billion increase…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 376 words out of ~1864.

      "content": "---\ntitle: The Buffett Indicator: Market Cap to GDP\nauthor: Silvan Frank\ndescription: Market Cap to GDP is a long-term valuation indicator for stocks. It has become popular in recent years, thanks to Warren Buffett.\ndate: 2001-12-10\n---\nThe Buffett Indicator, also known as Market Cap to GDP, has gained prominence as a long-term valuation indicator for stocks, largely due to Warren Buffett's endorsement. In a [Fortune Magazine](http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2001/12/10/314691/index.htm) interview back in 2001, Buffett referred to it as \"probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment.\" This statement has drawn attention to the indicator's potential significance in assessing market conditions. The calculation of the Buffett Indicator involves dividing the total market value of all publicly-traded stocks within a country by the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). By comparing the stock market's size to the overall economic output, this ratio provides insights into the relative valuation of the market. To illustrate this concept, one common approach is to examine the ratio between the **Wilshire 5000** and the GDP of the United States. The Wilshire 5000 is widely regarded as the definitive benchmark for the US equity market, aiming to measure the total market capitalization of all US equity securities with readily available price data. By dividing this market index by the GDP, we can obtain a snapshot of the market's valuation in relation to the country's economic performance.\n\nIn contrast to the **Wilshire 5000**, the numerator in the chart above includes the total value of public *and private* equities. However, it only gets published quarterly and therefore is always lagging a bit behind. On the upside, it has data going back to the 1940s, thereby providing a more historical perspective.\n\nSimilar to the Buffett Indicator, the Dow Jones to GDP ratio provides insights into the relative valuation of the stock market compared to the size of the economy. In contrast to the **Wilshire 5000**, the **Dow Jones** only contains 30 publicly traded companies. The index is price-weighted, so stocks with a higher share price are given greater weight. For these reasons, it is not as accurate as the Wilshire 5000 for measuring the market capitalization. However, all these ratios look very similar - and since some calculations for the **Dow Jones** go back to 1790, this ratio provides an interesting historical…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 384 words out of ~599.

It has become popular in recent years, thanks to Warren Buffett.\ndate: 2001-12-10\n---\nThe Buffett Indicator, also known as Market Cap to GDP, has gained prominence as a long-term valuation indicator for stocks, largely due to Warren Buffett's endorsement. In a [Fortune Magazine](http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2001/12/10/314691/index.htm) interview back in 2001, Buffett referred to it as \"probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment.\" This statement has drawn attention to the indicator's potential significance in assessing market conditions. The calculation of the Buffett Indicator involves dividing the total market value of all publicly-traded stocks within a country by the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). By comparing the stock market's size to the overall economic output, this ratio provides insights into the relative valuation of the market. To illustrate this concept, one common approach is to examine the ratio between the **Wilshire 5000** and the GDP of the United States. The Wilshire 5000 is widely regarded as the definitive benchmark for the US equity market, aiming to measure the total market capitalization of all US equity securities with readily available price data. By dividing this market index by the GDP, we can obtain a snapshot of the market's valuation in relation to the country's economic performance.\n\nIn contrast to the **Wilshire 5000**, the numerator in the chart above includes the total value of public *and private* equities. However, it only gets published quarterly and therefore is always lagging a bit behind. On the upside, it has data going back to the 1940s, thereby providing a more historical perspective.\n\nSimilar to the Buffett Indicator, the Dow Jones to GDP ratio provides insights into the relative valuation of the stock market compared to the size of the economy. In contrast to the **Wilshire 5000**, the **Dow Jones** only contains 30 publicly traded companies. The index is price-weighted, so stocks with a higher share price are given greater weight. For these reasons, it is not as accurate as the Wilshire 5000 for measuring the market capitalization.

      "content": "Based on the following question, analyze it carefully and provide your probability estimate.\n\nQuestion: Will the Warren Buffett Indicator (Wilshire 5000 to GDP Ratio) be greater than 210.0% on March 28, 2025?\nBackground: In a 2001 article co-written with Fortune Magazine's Carol Loomis, Warren Buffett [said](https://web.archive.org/web/20141013162215/https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2001/12/10/314691/index.htm): \"The chart shows the market value of all publicly traded securities as a percentage of the country's business--that is, as a percentage of GNP. The ratio has certain limitations in telling you what you need to know. Still, it is probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment. And as you can see, nearly two years ago the ratio rose to an unprecedented level. That should have been a very strong warning signal.

Named after Warren Buffett, who called the ratio \\\"the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment\\\". (Buffett has since walked back those comments, hesitating to endorse any single measure as either comprehensive or consistent over time, but this ratio remains credited to his name). To calculate the ratio, we need to get data for both metrics: Total Market Value and GDP.\\n\\n##### Total Market Value\\n\\nThe most common measurement of the aggregate value of the US stock market is the Wilshire 5000. This is available directly from Wilshire (links to all data sources [below](https://www.currentmarketvaluation.com#data-sources-section)), with monthly data starting in 1971, and daily measures beginning in 1980.

It has become popular in recent years, thanks to Warren Buffett.\\ndate: 2001-12-10\\n---\\nThe Buffett Indicator, also known as Market Cap to GDP, has gained prominence as a long-term valuation indicator for stocks, largely due to Warren Buffett's endorsement. In a [Fortune Magazine](http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2001/12/10/314691/index.htm) interview back in 2001, Buffett referred to it as \\\"probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment.\\\" This statement has drawn attention to the indicator's potential significance in assessing market conditions. The calculation of the Buffett Indicator involves dividing the total market value of all publicly-traded stocks within a country by the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). By comparing the stock market's size to the overall economic output, this ratio provides insights into the relative valuation of the market. To illustrate this concept, one common approach is to examine the ratio between the **Wilshire 5000** and the GDP of the United States. The Wilshire 5000 is widely regarded as the definitive benchmark for the US equity market, aiming to measure the total market capitalization of all US equity securities with readily available price data. By dividing this market index by the GDP, we can obtain a snapshot of the market's valuation in relation to the country's economic performance.\\n\\nIn contrast to the **Wilshire 5000**, the numerator in the chart above includes the total value of public *and private* equities. However, it only gets published quarterly and therefore is always lagging a bit behind. On the upside, it has data going back to the 1940s, thereby providing a more historical perspective.\\n\\nSimilar to the Buffett Indicator, the Dow Jones to GDP ratio provides insights into the relative valuation of the stock market compared to the size of the economy. In contrast to the **Wilshire 5000**, the **Dow Jones** only contains 30 publicly traded companies. The index is price-weighted, so stocks with a higher share price are given greater weight. For these reasons, it is not as accurate as the Wilshire 5000 for measuring the market capitalization. However, all these ratios look very similar - and since some calculations for the **Dow Jones** go back to 1790, this ratio provides an interesting historical\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 384 words out of ~599.

In a Fortune Magazine interview back in 2001, Buffett referred to it as \\\"probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment.\\\" This statement has drawn attention to the indicator's potential significance in assessing market conditions. The calculation of the Buffett Indicator involves dividing the total market value of all publicly-traded stocks within a country by the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). By comparing the stock market's size to the overall economic output, this ratio provides insights into the relative valuation of the market. To illustrate this concept, one common approach is to examine the ratio between the Wilshire 5000 and the GDP of the United States. The Wilshire 5000 is widely regarded as the definitive benchmark for the US equity market, aiming to measure the total market capitalization of all US equity securities with readily available price data. By dividing this market index by the GDP, we can obtain a snapshot of the market's valuation in relation to the country's economic performance.\", \"question\": \"Will the Warren Buffett Indicator (Wilshire 5000 to GDP Ratio) be greater than 210.0% on March 28, 2025?\", \"present_date\": \"2025-03-21T16:55:14.548598\"}"

Each participant’s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with her or his assessment of appropriate monetary policy—including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run value—and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes. The longer-run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.\\n\\nTable 1.

This value is already above the threshold of 210.0%.\n\n2. **Historical Context**: The current value of 211% is approximately 66.99% above its historical trend line, indicating that the market is strongly overvalued. Historically, such high values have been associated with market bubbles, such as during the Dot-com bubble of 2000.\n\n3. **Economic Projections**: The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) projects real GDP growth for 2025 to be between 1.5% and 1.9%, with a median of 1.7%. This suggests modest economic growth, which may not significantly alter the GDP component of the ratio.\n\n4. **Market Conditions**: Given the current overvaluation and the lack of significant economic shocks expected according to the FOMC's projections, it is plausible that the stock market valuation relative to GDP could remain elevated in the short term.\n\nConsidering these factors, the probability that the Warren Buffett Indicator will remain above 210.0% on March 28, 2025, is quite high, given that it is already at 211% and economic conditions do not suggest a rapid change.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.85"
