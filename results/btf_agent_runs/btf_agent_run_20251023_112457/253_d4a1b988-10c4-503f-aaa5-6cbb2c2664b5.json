  "question": "Will the Dallas Mavericks have fewer than 4.6 million Instagram followers on March 30, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.95,
  "reasoning": "Based on the information retrieved, as of the latest update, the Dallas Mavericks have 3,717,849 followers on Instagram. This is significantly below the threshold of 4.6 million followers required for the question to resolve as NO.\n\nGiven this current follower count and the proximity to the resolution date (March 30, 2025), it seems unlikely that the follower count will increase to exceed 4.6 million in such a short period.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the Dallas Mavericks will have fewer than 4.6 million Instagram followers on March 30, 2025, is quite high.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.95",

This is significantly below the threshold of 4.6 million followers required for the question to resolve as NO.\n\nGiven this current follower count and the proximity to the resolution date (March 30, 2025), it seems unlikely that the follower count will increase to exceed 4.6 million in such a short period.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the Dallas Mavericks will have fewer than 4.6 million Instagram followers on March 30, 2025, is quite high.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.95"
