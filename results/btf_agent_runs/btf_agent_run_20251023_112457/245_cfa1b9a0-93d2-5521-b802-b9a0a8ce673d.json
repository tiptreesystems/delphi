  "question": "Will the number of lawsuits filed against the Trump Administration according to the JustSecurity tracker be greater than 70 on March 31, 2025?",
  "probability": 1.0,
  "reasoning": "Based on the information gathered:\n\n1. **Just Security Tracker**: As of March 20, 2025, the Just Security tracker lists 132 cases against the Trump Administration, with 2 of these cases closed. This indicates a high level of legal activity and suggests that the number of lawsuits is well above the threshold of 70 required for the question to resolve as YES.\n\n2. **AP News**: The AP News tracker mentions \"dozens\" of lawsuits filed against the Trump Administration's executive actions, which aligns with the notion of significant legal challenges but does not provide a specific count.\n\n3. **New York Times**: The New York Times lists numerous lawsuits against the Trump Administration, covering a wide range of issues. The presence of ongoing appeals and recent developments in high-profile cases further supports the idea of a substantial number of legal challenges.\n\nGiven the confirmation from the Just Security tracker that the number of lawsuits is 132, which is well above the threshold of 70, the probability that the number of lawsuits will be greater than 70 by March 31, 2025, is extremely high.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 1.0",
