  "question": "Will the debt ceiling be raised or suspended in the US before March 17, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.85,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here are the key points regarding the likelihood of the U.S. debt ceiling being raised or suspended before March 17, 2025:\n\n1. **Extraordinary Measures**: The U.S. Treasury has been using extraordinary measures since January 17, 2025, to avoid default. These measures are expected to last until March 14, 2025. This provides a short window for Congress to act before the government risks default.\n\n2. **Historical Precedent**: Historically, Congress has acted 78 times since 1960 to raise, temporarily extend, or revise the debt limit. This indicates a strong precedent for action to avoid default.\n\n3. **Political Context**: The current political situation involves a Republican-controlled Congress and a Democratic President, which historically has led to brinkmanship over the debt ceiling. This was evident in 2023 when similar brinkmanship led to a credit downgrade of U.S. debt.\n\n4. **Economic Consequences**: Failing to increase the debt limit would lead to catastrophic economic consequences, including a potential default on legal obligations and a financial crisis. This provides a strong incentive for Congress to act to prevent such outcomes.\n\n5. **Current Negotiations**: There is no specific information on the current state of negotiations, but the urgency of the situation and the historical precedent suggest that Congress is likely working towards a resolution.\n\nGiven these factors, while there is political tension, the historical precedent and severe consequences of inaction suggest a high probability that the debt ceiling will be raised or suspended before the deadline.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.85",

It is the Executive Branch’s responsibility to execute that borrowing. The Debt Ceiling is the limit Congress has set up to which Treasury can borrow. It is a limit up to which Treasury can pay the bills and honor commitments that Congress has already made.\n\n### Why do we have a debt ceiling?\n\nThe debt ceiling is an accident of history. Before World War I, Congress had to authorize Treasury every time it had to issue debt to meet obligations. In 1917 legislation was passed to create an early debt ceiling that allowed the Treasury Secretary to have more flexibility in debt issuance for spending Congress had already authorized. Amendments to the 1917 through 1941 created the modern debt ceiling as we know it today. It was never intended to be an implement for Congress to reduce future spending or gain leverage in the negotiation of other legislation.\n\n\n## THE BASICS\n\n### How high is the debt ceiling?\n\nAfter being suspended by the [Fiscal Responsibility Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3746) through January 1, 2025 the debt ceiling has been reinstated. On January 2nd, it was set to the level of obligations accrued during the suspension, or $36.1 trillion. On January 17th, 2025, Treasury [announced](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Debt-Limit-Letter-to-Congress-1-17-25.pdf) it would begin extraordinary measures on January 21st to avoid default.\n\n### What happens when we reach the debt ceiling?\n\nWhen the debt ceiling is reached, Congress must pass legislation to raise or suspend the limit. Failure to do so would lead to default and have catastrophic consequences for all Americans and the global economy.\n\nAfter the debt ceilin…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 375 words out of ~1269.

It is the Executive Branch’s responsibility to execute that borrowing. The Debt Ceiling is the limit Congress has set up to which Treasury can borrow. It is a limit up to which Treasury can pay the bills and honor commitments that Congress has already made.\n\n### Why do we have a debt ceiling?\n\nThe debt ceiling is an accident of history. Before World War I, Congress had to authorize Treasury every time it had to issue debt to meet obligations. In 1917 legislation was passed to create an early debt ceiling that allowed the Treasury Secretary to have more flexibility in debt issuance for spending Congress had already authorized. Amendments to the 1917 through 1941 created the modern debt ceiling as we know it today. It was never intended to be an implement for Congress to reduce future spending or gain leverage in the negotiation of other legislation.\n\n\n## THE BASICS\n\n### How high is the debt ceiling?\n\nAfter being suspended by the [Fiscal Responsibility Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3746) through January 1, 2025 the debt ceiling has been reinstated. On January 2nd, it was set to the level of obligations accrued during the suspension, or $36.1 trillion.

      "content": "Based on the following question, analyze it carefully and provide your probability estimate.\n\nQuestion: Will the debt ceiling be raised or suspended in the US before March 17, 2025?\nBackground: *This question is part of the* [*Bridgewater Forecasting Contest*](https://www.metaculus.com/bridgewater/)*. To be eligible to win prizes in the competition you must register for the tournament. The last day to register is March 24, 2025. Sign up or check your registration status* [*here*](https://www.metaculus.com/bridgewater/)*.*\n\n***\n\nThe [debt limit](https://www.crfb.org/papers/qa-everything-you-should-know-about-debt-ceiling) or debt ceiling in the United States, first established in 1917, sets a limit on the amount of money the US Treasury can borrow. As the US typically borrows to pay prior obligations, reaching the debt limit also limits the ability of the Treasury to fulfill debt obligations, risking default. When the debt limit is reached the Treasury will typically undertake [extraordinary measures](https://www.crfb.org/papers/qa-everything-you-should-know-about-debt-ceiling#what_are_extraordinary_measures) to avoid default as long as possible.\n\nThe debt ceiling was last suspended in June 2023, but the suspension [expired in January 2025](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/17/business/debt-ceiling-limit-congress/index.html). On January 17, outgoing Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen [notified Congress](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2798) that the Treasury had begun taking extraordinary measures to avoid default, including implementing a \"debt issuance suspension period\" on certain funds the government typically invests. This suspension period was specified to persist through March 14, 2025.\n\n[According to the Peter G. Peterson Foundation](https://www.pgpf.org/article/the-debt-ceiling-will-be-reinstated-on-january-1-heres-whats-at-stake/):\n\n> The extraordinary measures and cash balance typically can last up to a few months. Most recently, extraordinary measures enabled the government to continue meeting its obligations from January 2023 until lawmakers suspended the debt ceiling in June 2023 as part of the [Fiscal Responsibility Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3746).\n>\n> If the available options are exhausted prior to legislation being enacted to adjust the debt ceiling, the United States would default on its debt.\n\nThe brinkmanship involved in the 2023 debt ceiling suspension was a contributing factor to the US' credit rating being [downgraded](https://www.pgpf.org/article/moodys-lowers-us-credit-rating-to-negative-citing-large-federal-deficits/) by two credit agencies, Fitch and Moody's, later in 2023.\n\nReaching an agreement to raise or suspend the debt ceiling [could be difficult](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/gop-ponders-raise-debt-ceiling-dozens-members-ve-always-held-rcna188824) for President Trump and Congress due to the Republicans' thin majority in the House of Representatives.\n\nFor additional resources, see a [tracker of the historical debt limit and debt subject to limit](https://www.ryanbeckauthor.com/forecasting/DebtLimit.html) and the Congressional Research Service report [*Debt Limit Policy Questions: How Long Do Extraordinary Measures Last?*](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN12147)\nResolution criteria: This resolves as **Yes** if, before March 17, 2025, Eastern Time, the United States enacts a law that increases the statutory debt limit, suspends it for any period of time, or abolishes it, according to reporting from [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).&#x20;\nFine print: * Any amount of increase to the debt limit qualifies.\n* Only an enacted law is sufficient. Attempts to increase, suspend, or abolish the debt limit by other means, such as by executive order, are immaterial.\npresent_date: 2025-03-01T11:26:31.016896\n\n\nMake sure to use the tools at your disposal to gather relevant information before providing your final probability estimate.\n\nYou may reason through the problem, but you MUST end your response with:\nFINAL PROBABILITY: [your decimal number between 0 and 1]"

As the US typically borrows to pay prior obligations, reaching the debt limit also limits the ability of the Treasury to fulfill debt obligations, risking default. When the debt limit is reached the Treasury will typically undertake extraordinary measures to avoid default as long as possible. The debt ceiling was last suspended in June 2023, but the suspension expired in January 2025. On January 17, outgoing Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen notified Congress that the Treasury had begun taking extraordinary measures to avoid default, including implementing a \\\"debt issuance suspension period\\\" on certain funds the government typically invests. This suspension period was specified to persist through March 14, 2025. The extraordinary measures and cash balance typically can last up to a few months. Most recently, extraordinary measures enabled the government to continue meeting its obligations from January 2023 until lawmakers suspended the debt ceiling in June 2023 as part of the Fiscal Responsibility Act. If the available options are exhausted prior to legislation being enacted to adjust the debt ceiling, the United States would default on its debt. The brinkmanship involved in the 2023 debt ceiling suspension was a contributing factor to the US' credit rating being downgraded by two credit agencies, Fitch and Moody's, later in 2023. Reaching an agreement to raise or suspend the debt ceiling could be difficult for President Trump and Congress due to the Republicans' thin majority in the House of Representatives.\",\"resolution_criteria\":\"This resolves as Yes if, before March 17, 2025, Eastern Time, the United States enacts a law that increases the statutory debt limit, suspends it for any period of time, or abolishes it, according to reporting from credible sources.\",\"present_date\":\"2025-03-01T11:26:31.016896\",\"date_cutoff_start\":null,\"date_cutoff_end\":null,\"scoring_weight\":1.0,\"resolution\":\"unknown\",\"resolved_at\":null,\"max_queries\":5}"

It is the Executive Branch\\u2019s responsibility to execute that borrowing. The Debt Ceiling is the limit Congress has set up to which Treasury can borrow. It is a limit up to which Treasury can pay the bills and honor commitments that Congress has already made.\\n\\n### Why do we have a debt ceiling?\\n\\nThe debt ceiling is an accident of history. Before World War I, Congress had to authorize Treasury every time it had to issue debt to meet obligations. In 1917 legislation was passed to create an early debt ceiling that allowed the Treasury Secretary to have more flexibility in debt issuance for spending Congress had already authorized. Amendments to the 1917 through 1941 created the modern debt ceiling as we know it today. It was never intended to be an implement for Congress to reduce future spending or gain leverage in the negotiation of other legislation.\\n\\n\\n## THE BASICS\\n\\n### How high is the debt ceiling?\\n\\nAfter being suspended by the [Fiscal Responsibility Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3746) through January 1, 2025 the debt ceiling has been reinstated. On January 2nd, it was set to the level of obligations accrued during the suspension, or $36.1 trillion. On January 17th, 2025, Treasury [announced](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Debt-Limit-Letter-to-Congress-1-17-25.pdf) it would begin extraordinary measures on January 21st to avoid default.\\n\\n### What happens when we reach the debt ceiling?\\n\\nWhen the debt ceiling is reached, Congress must pass legislation to raise or suspend the limit. Failure to do so would lead to default and have catastrophic consequences for all Americans and the global economy.\\n\\nAfter the debt ceilin\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 375 words out of ~1269.

The Constitution grants Congress the sole authority to borrow on behalf of the United States. It is the Executive Branch’s responsibility to execute that borrowing. The Debt Ceiling is the limit Congress has set up to which Treasury can borrow. It is a limit up to which Treasury can pay the bills and honor commitments that Congress has already made. The debt ceiling is an accident of history. Before World War I, Congress had to authorize Treasury every time it had to issue debt to meet obligations. In 1917 legislation was passed to create an early debt ceiling that allowed the Treasury Secretary to have more flexibility in debt issuance for spending Congress had already authorized. Amendments to the 1917 through 1941 created the modern debt ceiling as we know it today. It was never intended to be an implement for Congress to reduce future spending or gain leverage in the negotiation of other legislation. After being suspended by the Fiscal Responsibility Act through January 1, 2025 the debt ceiling has been reinstated. On January 2nd, it was set to the level of obligations accrued during the suspension, or $36.1 trillion. On January 17th, 2025, Treasury announced it would begin extraordinary measures on January 21st to avoid default. When the debt ceiling is reached, Congress must pass legislation to raise or suspend the limit.

Since 2011, BPC has played a leading role in educating policymakers and the public about the X Date. Using publicly available data on government cash flows and changes in intragovernmental debt, BPC projects an X Date range—reflecting the inherent uncertainty—to help policymakers understand the period of time when the risk of inaction rises dramatically.

      "content": "Based on the gathered evidence, here are the key points regarding the likelihood of the U.S. debt ceiling being raised or suspended before March 17, 2025:\n\n1. **Extraordinary Measures**: The U.S. Treasury has been using extraordinary measures since January 17, 2025, to avoid default. These measures are expected to last until March 14, 2025. This provides a short window for Congress to act before the government risks default.\n\n2. **Historical Precedent**: Historically, Congress has acted 78 times since 1960 to raise, temporarily extend, or revise the debt limit. This indicates a strong precedent for action to avoid default.\n\n3. **Political Context**: The current political situation involves a Republican-controlled Congress and a Democratic President, which historically has led to brinkmanship over the debt ceiling. This was evident in 2023 when similar brinkmanship led to a credit downgrade of U.S. debt.\n\n4. **Economic Consequences**: Failing to increase the debt limit would lead to catastrophic economic consequences, including a potential default on legal obligations and a financial crisis. This provides a strong incentive for Congress to act to prevent such outcomes.\n\n5. **Current Negotiations**: There is no specific information on the current state of negotiations, but the urgency of the situation and the historical precedent suggest that Congress is likely working towards a resolution.\n\nGiven these factors, while there is political tension, the historical precedent and severe consequences of inaction suggest a high probability that the debt ceiling will be raised or suspended before the deadline.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.85"
