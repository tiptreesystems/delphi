  "question": "Will the DC cherry trees reach peak bloom on March 30 in 2025?",
  "probability": 0.4,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, the National Park Service and other sources have predicted that the peak bloom for the DC cherry blossoms in 2025 will occur between March 28 and 31. Historically, the average peak bloom date has been trending earlier, with recent averages around March 27 to March 30. The current stage of the cherry blossoms as of March 20, 2025, is \"Peduncle Elongation,\" which is a key stage before peak bloom.\n\nGiven these predictions and historical trends, it is likely that the peak bloom could occur on March 30, 2025, as it falls within the predicted window. However, the exact date is still subject to weather conditions and other environmental factors.\n\nConsidering all the information, I estimate the probability of the DC cherry trees reaching peak bloom on March 30, 2025, as follows:\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.4",

Peak bloom varies annually depending on weather conditions. The most likely time to reach peak bloom is between the last week of March and the first week of April. Extraordinary warm or cool temperatures have resulted in peak bloom as early as March 15 (1990) and as late as April 18 (1958).\n\n\n**How long is peak bloom? **\n\nThe Yoshino trees typically bloom for a period of **several days**. The length of the blooming period depends on weather conditions. Cool, calm weather can extend the length of the bloom, and a rainy, windy day can bring an abrupt end to the ephemeral blossoms. A late frost can prevent the trees from blooming at all.\n\n\n**Predicting the bloom.**\n\nForecasting peak bloom is almost impossible more than **10 days in advance**. The cherry trees' blossom development is dependent on weather conditions. National Park Service horticulturists monitor bud development and report the status of the blossoms.\n\nYear |\nGreen Buds |\nFlorets Visible |\nExtension of Florets |\nPeduncle Elongation |\nPuffy White |\nPeak Bloom |\n| 2025 | Mar 11 |\nMar 16 |\nMar 19 |\nMar 20 |\n||\n| 2024 | Mar 2 | Mar 5 | Mar 8 | Mar 12 | Mar 15 | Mar 17 |\n| 2023 | Feb 23 | Mar 1 | Mar 7 | Mar 11 | Mar 18 | Mar 23 |\n| 2022 | Mar 3 | Mar 7 | Mar 14 | Mar 17 | Mar 19 | Mar 21 |\n| 2021 | Mar 11 | Mar 16 | Mar 22 | Mar 24 | Mar 26 | Mar 28 |\n| 2020 | Feb 28 | Mar 3 | Mar 9 | Mar 12 | Mar 16 | Mar 20 |\n| 2019 | Mar 5 | Mar 17 | Mar 23 | Mar 25 | Mar 29 | Apr 1 |\n| 2018 | Feb 25 | Mar 15 | Mar 26 | Mar 29 | Apr 1 | Apr 5 |\n| 2017 | Feb 24 | Mar 1 | Mar 6 | Mar 8 | Mar 22* | Mar 25* |\n| 2016 | Mar 8 | Mar 13 | Mar 15 | Mar 17 | Mar 22 | Mar 25 |\n| 2015 | Mar 18 | Apr 1 | Apr 4 | Apr 6 | Apr 8 | Apr 10 |\n| 2014 | Mar 16 | Ma…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 482 words out of ~848.

But that’s not exactly the same thing as what we might commonly call “full bloom” or the “blooming period.”\n\nOften the news reports themselves get confused. If the National Park Service predicts that peak bloom will be April 1-5, for example, it doesn’t mean that the flowers will start blooming on April 1 and stop on April 5, which is how some (but not all) news reports wrongly interpret it. It also doesn’t mean that they’ll even be in full bloom for that entire time.\n\nSo it’s useful to know what that means if you’re planning your visit. The peak bloom date is an important milestone in the process, but it’s not the only day you can see beautiful cherry blossoms.\n\n### Average Peak Bloom Dates\n\nThe National Park Service peak bloom date record-keeping began in 1921. **The overall average since then is April 3. **\n\nBut in recent decades, it has been trending earlier. **If you only look at the period since 1990, the average is March 30. **\n\nAnd if you look only at the decade **from 2015 to 2024, the average is March 27**.\n\n| Decade | Bloom Day of the Year | Average Bloom Date |\n|---|---|---|\n| 1921-1929 | 92.7 | April 02 |\n| 1930-1939 | 96.8 | April 06 |\n| 1940-1949 | 93.4 | April 03 |\n| 1950-1959 | 96.8 | April 06 |\n| 1960-1969 | 97.4 | April 07 |\n| 1970-1979 | 95.5 | April 05 |\n| 1980-1989 | 93.3 | April 03 |\n| 1990-1999 | 90.9 | March 31 |\n| 2000-2009 | 90.7 | March 31 |\n| 2010-2019 | 91.2 | April 01 |\n| 2020-2024 | 81.2 | March 22 |\n\n## What the Peak Bloom Predictions Mean\n\nThe official forecast for the peak bloom period is issued by the [National Park Service](http://www.nps.gov/cherry/cherry-blossom-bloom.htm). It is their horticulturists that look after these remarkable trees. Their predictions are based on a mix of historical data, weather observations and forecasts, long experience in working hands-on with the trees (some of the NP…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 442 words out of ~2802.

Peak bloom varies annually depending on weather conditions. The most likely time to reach peak bloom is between the last week of March and the first week of April. Extraordinary warm or cool temperatures have resulted in peak bloom as early as March 15 (1990) and as late as April 18 (1958).\n\n\n**How long is peak bloom? **\n\nThe Yoshino trees typically bloom for a period of **several days**. The length of the blooming period depends on weather conditions. Cool, calm weather can extend the length of the bloom, and a rainy, windy day can bring an abrupt end to the ephemeral blossoms. A late frost can prevent the trees from blooming at all.\n\n\n**Predicting the bloom.**\n\nForecasting peak bloom is almost impossible more than **10 days in advance**. The cherry trees' blossom development is dependent on weather conditions. National Park Service horticulturists monitor bud development and report the status of the blossoms.\n\nYear |\nGreen Buds |\nFlorets Visible |\nExtension of Florets |\nPeduncle Elongation |\nPuffy White |\nPeak Bloom |\n| 2025 | Mar 11 |\nMar 16 |\nMar 19 |\nMar 20 |\n||\n| 2024 | Mar 2 | Mar 5 | Mar 8 | Mar 12 | Mar 15 | Mar 17 |\n| 2023 | Feb 23 | Mar 1 | Mar 7 | Mar 11 | Mar 18 | Mar 23 |\n| 2022 | Mar 3 | Mar 7 | Mar 14 | Mar 17 | Mar 19 | Mar 21 |\n| 2021 | Mar 11 | Mar 16 | Mar 22 | Mar 24 | Mar 26 | Mar 28 |\n| 2020 | Feb 28 | Mar 3 | Mar 9 | Mar 12 | Mar 16 | Mar 20 |\n| 2019 | Mar 5 | Mar 17 | Mar 23 | Mar 25 | Mar 29 | Apr 1 |\n| 2018 | Feb 25 | Mar 15 | Mar 26 | Mar 29 | Apr 1 | Apr 5 |\n| 2017 | Feb 24 | Mar 1 | Mar 6 | Mar 8 | Mar 22* | Mar 25* |\n| 2016 | Mar 8 | Mar 13 | Mar 15 | Mar 17 | Mar 22 | Mar 25 |\n| 2015 | Mar 18 | Apr 1 | Apr 4 | Apr 6 | Apr 8 | Apr 10 |\n| 2014 | Mar 16 | Ma…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 482 words out of ~848.

Peak bloom varies annually depending on weather conditions. The most likely time to reach peak bloom is between the last week of March and the first week of April. Extraordinary warm or cool temperatures have resulted in peak bloom as early as March 15 (1990) and as late as April 18 (1958).\\n\\n\\n**How long is peak bloom? **\\n\\nThe Yoshino trees typically bloom for a period of **several days**. The length of the blooming period depends on weather conditions. Cool, calm weather can extend the length of the bloom, and a rainy, windy day can bring an abrupt end to the ephemeral blossoms. A late frost can prevent the trees from blooming at all.\\n\\n\\n**Predicting the bloom.**\\n\\nForecasting peak bloom is almost impossible more than **10 days in advance**. The cherry trees' blossom development is dependent on weather conditions. National Park Service horticulturists monitor bud development and report the status of the blossoms.\\n\\nYear |\\nGreen Buds |\\nFlorets Visible |\\nExtension of Florets |\\nPeduncle Elongation |\\nPuffy White |\\nPeak Bloom |\\n| 2025 | Mar 11 |\\nMar 16 |\\nMar 19 |\\nMar 20 |\\n||\\n| 2024 | Mar 2 | Mar 5 | Mar 8 | Mar 12 | Mar 15 | Mar 17 |\\n| 2023 | Feb 23 | Mar 1 | Mar 7 | Mar 11 | Mar 18 | Mar 23 |\\n| 2022 | Mar 3 | Mar 7 | Mar 14 | Mar 17 | Mar 19 | Mar 21 |\\n| 2021 | Mar 11 | Mar 16 | Mar 22 | Mar 24 | Mar 26 | Mar 28 |\\n| 2020 | Feb 28 | Mar 3 | Mar 9 | Mar 12 | Mar 16 | Mar 20 |\\n| 2019 | Mar 5 | Mar 17 | Mar 23 | Mar 25 | Mar 29 | Apr 1 |\\n| 2018 | Feb 25 | Mar 15 | Mar 26 | Mar 29 | Apr 1 | Apr 5 |\\n| 2017 | Feb 24 | Mar 1 | Mar 6 | Mar 8 | Mar 22* | Mar 25* |\\n| 2016 | Mar 8 | Mar 13 | Mar 15 | Mar 17 | Mar 22 | Mar 25 |\\n| 2015 | Mar 18 | Apr 1 | Apr 4 | Apr 6 | Apr 8 | Apr 10 |\\n| 2014 | Mar 16 | Ma\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 482 words out of ~848.

But that’s not exactly the same thing as what we might commonly call “full bloom” or the “blooming period.”\n\nOften the news reports themselves get confused. If the National Park Service predicts that peak bloom will be April 1-5, for example, it doesn’t mean that the flowers will start blooming on April 1 and stop on April 5, which is how some (but not all) news reports wrongly interpret it. It also doesn’t mean that they’ll even be in full bloom for that entire time.\n\nSo it’s useful to know what that means if you’re planning your visit. The peak bloom date is an important milestone in the process, but it’s not the only day you can see beautiful cherry blossoms.\n\n### Average Peak Bloom Dates\n\nThe National Park Service peak bloom date record-keeping began in 1921. **The overall average since then is April 3. **\n\nBut in recent decades, it has been trending earlier. **If you only look at the period since 1990, the average is March 30. **\n\nAnd if you look only at the decade **from 2015 to 2024, the average is March 27**.\n\n| Decade | Bloom Day of the Year | Average Bloom Date |\n|---|---|---|\n| 1921-1929 | 92.7 | April 02 |\n| 1930-1939 | 96.8 | April 06 |\n| 1940-1949 | 93.4 | April 03 |\n| 1950-1959 | 96.8 | April 06 |\n| 1960-1969 | 97.4 | April 07 |\n| 1970-1979 | 95.5 | April 05 |\n| 1980-1989 | 93.3 | April 03 |\n| 1990-1999 | 90.9 | March 31 |\n| 2000-2009 | 90.7 | March 31 |\n| 2010-2019 | 91.2 | April 01 |\n| 2020-2024 | 81.2 | March 22 |\n\n## What the Peak Bloom Predictions Mean\n\nThe official forecast for the peak bloom period is issued by the [National Park Service](http://www.nps.gov/cherry/cherry-blossom-bloom.htm).

Peak bloom varies annually depending on weather conditions. The most likely time to reach peak bloom is between the last week of March and the first week of April. Extraordinary warm or cool temperatures have resulted in peak bloom as early as March 15 (1990) and as late as April 18 (1958).\\n\\n\\n**How long is peak bloom? **\\n\\nThe Yoshino trees typically bloom for a period of **several days**. The length of the blooming period depends on weather conditions. Cool, calm weather can extend the length of the bloom, and a rainy, windy day can bring an abrupt end to the ephemeral blossoms. A late frost can prevent the trees from blooming at all.\\n\\n\\n**Predicting the bloom.**\\n\\nForecasting peak bloom is almost impossible more than **10 days in advance**. The cherry trees' blossom development is dependent on weather conditions.

If the National Park Service predicts that peak bloom will be April 1-5, for example, it doesn\\u2019t mean that the flowers will start blooming on April 1 and stop on April 5, which is how some (but not all) news reports wrongly interpret it. It also doesn\\u2019t mean that they\\u2019ll even be in full bloom for that entire time.\\n\\nSo it\\u2019s useful to know what that means if you\\u2019re planning your visit.

Peak bloom varies annually depending on weather conditions. The most likely time to reach peak bloom is between the last week of March and the first week of April. Extraordinary warm or cool temperatures have resulted in peak bloom as early as March 15 (1990) and as late as April 18 (1958).\\n\\n\\n**How long is peak bloom? **\\n\\nThe Yoshino trees typically bloom for a period of **several days**. The length of the blooming period depends on weather conditions. Cool, calm weather can extend the length of the bloom, and a rainy, windy day can bring an abrupt end to the ephemeral blossoms. A late frost can prevent the trees from blooming at all.\\n\\n\\n**Predicting the bloom.**\\n\\nForecasting peak bloom is almost impossible more than **10 days in advance**. The cherry trees' blossom development is dependent on weather conditions.

The current stage of the cherry blossoms as of March 20, 2025, is \"Peduncle Elongation,\" which is a key stage before peak bloom.\n\nGiven these predictions and historical trends, it is likely that the peak bloom could occur on March 30, 2025, as it falls within the predicted window. However, the exact date is still subject to weather conditions and other environmental factors.\n\nConsidering all the information, I estimate the probability of the DC cherry trees reaching peak bloom on March 30, 2025, as follows:\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.4"
