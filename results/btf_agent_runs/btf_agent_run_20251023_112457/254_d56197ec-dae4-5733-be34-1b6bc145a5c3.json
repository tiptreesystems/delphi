  "question": "Will Adam Lambert win the 2025 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Music Artist?",
  "probability": 0.25,
  "reasoning": "Based on the information gathered:\n\n1. Adam Lambert is nominated for the 2025 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Music Artist.\n2. Other nominees in the same category include Billie Eilish, Elton John, and Victoria Monét.\n3. The selection process for the GLAAD Media Awards involves over 700 voters and a review panel, with nominees evaluated based on fair representation, boldness, cultural impact, and overall quality.\n\nGiven the strong competition from well-known artists like Billie Eilish and Elton John, and considering the criteria used for evaluation, Adam Lambert's chances of winning are significant but not overwhelming. His nomination indicates recognition of his work, but the presence of other high-profile nominees suggests a competitive field.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.25",
