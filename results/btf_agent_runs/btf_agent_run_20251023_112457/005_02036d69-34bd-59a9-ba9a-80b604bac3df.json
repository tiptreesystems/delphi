  "question": "Will the ISW warmap show Kursk as having been completely retaken by Russia on March 31, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.85,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, the situation in the Kursk region as of mid-March 2025 indicates that Ukrainian forces have largely retreated from the area. Key points from the evidence include:\n\n1. **Ukrainian Retreat**: Ukrainian forces have pulled almost entirely out of the Kursk region, with reports indicating that they are holding only a small portion of the territory they previously controlled. By March 16, 2025, they were clinging to barely 30 square miles along the Russia-Ukraine border.\n\n2. **Russian Control**: Russian forces have reportedly regained full control of key areas such as the town of Sudzha. There are reports of successful Russian encirclement operations causing Ukrainian forces to retreat.\n\n3. **Strategic Context**: The retreat appears to be part of a broader strategic withdrawal by Ukraine, possibly influenced by ongoing geopolitical negotiations and the pressure from Russian and allied forces.\n\n4. **ISW Assessment**: The Institute for the Study of War has not confirmed significant encirclement of Ukrainian forces, suggesting some dispute over the extent of Russian control, but the overall trend indicates a strong Russian presence.\n\nGiven these factors, it seems likely that by March 31, 2025, the ISW warmap could show Kursk as having been completely retaken by Russia, as Ukrainian forces have been significantly pushed back and are in retreat.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.85",

It was the first time a foreign army had occupied Russian land since the second world war.\n\nRussia, with the help of North Korean troops, has been pushing Ukrainian forces back, and in recent weeks the pressure on Ukrainian positions has become overwhelming. On Wednesday, Vladimir Putin donned military fatigues to visit a command post in the region, and on Thursday, Russia announced it had regained full control of Sudzha.\n\nWhile Ukrainian troops continue to hold a few remaining villages in Kursk, soldiers involved in the operation said it was probably only a matter of time before the retreat was concluded.\n\n“The Russians are already pushing into Sumy region [in Ukraine], all the tasks now are defensive,” said Serhiy, a special operations commander who recently left the region.\n\nThe demand by Putin that troops create a “buffer zone” close to the border suggests a Russian offensive pushing back into Ukraine may be on the cards, and authorities have already evacuated several settlements close to the border.\n\nThe end of the seven-month operation has led to mixed assessments in Ukraine, with some saying it achieved many of its goals, and others wondering if it was a distraction from the main war effort and cost Ukrainian lives for no tangible gain.\n\n“Kursk displaced the conflict on to Russian territory, and Russia used some of its best units to fight for it, but it also required a sizeable number of Ukraine’s elite units to hold the pocket,” said Michael Kofman, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nNow, the Russian offensive may change the dynamic of the war again, at a moment when the US is pushing Moscow and Kyiv to sign a ceasefire agreement. “My worry is that this gives the Kremlin and the Russian army a new bout of enthusiasm and adrenaline,” the Kyiv-based political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko said.\n\nThe [initial incursion into Kursk](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/03/ukrainian-troops-audacious-incursion-russia-kursk) happened last August. It was planned by a very small circle to retain an element of surprise, and Kyiv did not even brief western allies until after the operation was under way. Troops arrived in nearby Sumy in small groups, and many stayed in rented apartments.\n\n[Documents recovered from Russian army positions](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/20/revealed-russia-anticipated-kursk-incursion-months-in-advance-seized-papers-show) showed that Moscow’s military planners had warned of the threat of an incursion for months, but when it came Ukrainian troops were able to overrun Russian positions, taking hundreds of prisoners of war.\n\nIn Sudzha, officials and police fled without even destroying or taking away sensitive documents, leaving them for Ukrainian troops to seize and send to Kyiv for analysis.\n\nThose with knowledge of the planning say Ukrainian officials were taken aback by just how well the initial stage of the operation went, as Ukraine took control of about 500 sq miles within a few days.\n\n“At the beginning, the idea was just to create a diversion and to draw troops away from Donbas. But it went better than expected and suddenly we were digging in,” said one source.\n\n“We have no wish to occupy this territory,” Zelenskyy’s aide Mykhailo Podolyak told the Guardian in late August. “Our tasks are to push Russian artillery and other systems further away, destroy the warehouses and other military infrastructure that is there, and also to affect public opinion in Russia.”\n\nFor the first time in the war, the shoe was on the other foot and Ukraine became an occupying power. The Ukrainian army took journalists on tours of Sudzha, where stunned residents could not believe the war they had seen on their television screens had arrived on Russian territory. A historian from Sumy [recorded a podcast](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/07/ukraine-sudzha-russian-town-kursk-region) in Sudzha’s small history museum, explaining how Sudzha and the rest of the region was historically Ukrainian land, a nod to Russian claims about Ukrainian territories.\n\nAt one point, there were plans to ask Russians who were fighting alongside Ukraine to enter the region and take over police functions. The idea would have been to troll Russia, which masked its 2014 intervention in Donbas as the work of Ukrainian separatists. However, the plans were quickly discarded as unworkable and incendiary.\n\nThe capture of hundreds of prisoners allowed Ukraine to offer an exchange for captured Ukrainians held in Russian jails, and the operation was also credited with providing a morale boost to Ukrainian troops and society after months of setbacks.\n\nThe longer Ukrainian troops held on to the land, the more it became clear that the endgame of the operation was now the chance to use Kursk as a card at future negotiations. Zelenskyy [told](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/11/zelenskyy-europe-cannot-guarantee-ukraines-security-without-america) the Guardian last month that Kyiv would “swap one territory for another”.\n\nHowever, as time went on, Russia upped the pressure on Ukrainian positions in the region. By the beginning of this year, Ukrainian military planners could see Russia making a sustained effort to concentrate forces on Kursk.\n\n“Everything is going to Kursk,” one military source said in early February. “At the beginning they didn’t seem to pay that much attention to it, but then the North Koreans came, and then since the beginning of the year they are throwing everything at Kursk, perhaps to try to take it back before negotiating.”\n\nSome of Russia’s best drone units were relocated to the Kursk theatre. Because Ukrainian forces can use radio jammers to block Russian FPV (first person view) drones, Russia has increasingly begun using fibre optic drones, which unspool a thin cable over several miles and are immune to jammers.\n\n“The fields we are retreating through are like a spider’s web with all the fibre optic cables,” said Serhiy, the special operations commander.\n\nHe criticised the failure to build nets around the main road between Sumy and Sudzha to protect it from drones, as the Russians have done in part of the front in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region. “Only in the last two weeks they started trying to do this, but now it’s too dangerous. They should have done it in September, October, when everything was calm,” he said.\n\nUkrainian officials say that while ultimately the operation will not provide the hoped-for bargaining chip, it was able to change the narrative of the war, at a time when gloominess over Ukrainian prospects for any kind of advance had set in. They say that while the withdrawal may be fraught, it has so far passed without enormous loss of life or stubbornly holding on to undefendable positions.\n\n“After seven months, we simply withdrew. There was no encirclement,” said one senior security official, painting the operation as a success. “There were political goals, military goals, there was getting the Russians to move troops from Pokrovsk [in Donetsk] to Kursk. And we showed how shameful it is for the Russians, that they can’t fight Ukraine without North Koreans.”\n\nOthers had a more mixed assessment, noting that the offensive stretched Ukraine’s already understaffed forces, and did not slow the Russian advance in the east. “Tactically it was successful, but the offensive changed little in the overall dynamic of this war, and failed to achieve its wider operational objectives,” Kofman said."

Ahead of talks between Presidents Trump and Putin this week, he has no cards left to play.\n\nAccording to the [New York Times on Sunday](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/16/world/europe/ukraine-kursk-retreat-russia.html), Ukrainian troops are all but gone from the Russian Kursk region. At the peak of last August's offensive, Ukraine held 500 square miles of the Russian territory.

It is absolutely clear to me that for President Putin, retaking Kursk was essential to putting him in the best possible place to negotiate.\n\nZelensky had gambled on improving his hand of cards in future ceasefire talks by being able to trade land in [Russia](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/tag/russia/) for the return of land in Ukraine. That gamble has failed. Prior to the past week, based on the Institute for the Study of War [ battle map](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/36a7f6a6f5a9448496de641cf64bd375), Russia had already occupied three-to-four times more land in Ukraine than was seized in Kursk.\n\nOver the past 11 years, I have witnessed Russia’s preference for upping the military ante to put themselves in the strongest possible position before striking a deal. What has happened over the past week has been, in many respects, a carbon copy of the tactics Russia used immediately before the agreement of the Minsk 1 and Minsk 2 peace deals.\n\nAfter the separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk seized power following the February 2014 ouster of President Yanukovych, the Ukrainian army launched an Anti-Terror Operation to regain control of the Donbas. This led to considerable success on the Ukrainian side and the recapture of several large towns. With Ukrainian forces reaching the outskirts of Luhansk and Donetsk cities, the Russian military stepped into the conflict. On August 29, 2014, Russian formations encircled the town of Ilovaisk, inflicting a [ bloody defeat](about:blank) on the Ukrainian formations who are thought to have lost up to four hundred personnel. Just days later, the First Minsk agreement was signed, offering concessions to the separatists in the form of progress towards devolution.\n\nThe Ukrainian side didn’t push forward with devolution or a promised ‘national dialogue’. While the line of contact largely held, there were repeated violations of the ceasefire and casualties on both sides, including civilian casualties in the separatist areas which were verified by the [ OSCE Special Monitoring Mission](https://www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/121431). In late January 2015, Russian backed Wagner troops mounted a brutal and, ultimately, successful encirclement of the town of\n\n[, causing a withdrawal of Ukrainian troops.](https://archive.smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/battle-debaltseve-hybrid-army-classic-battle-encirclement)\n\n__Debaltseve__This battle of Debaltseve precipitated the negotiations in Minsk on February 11-12 to agree to the [ second Minsk agreement](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/05/minsk-conundrum-western-policy-and-russias-war-eastern-ukraine-0/minsk-2-agreement), with Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande at the talks. Minsk II strengthened the requirements on the Ukrainian side to push forward with devolution in the Donbas.

According to reports, several hundred Russian troops [ crawled around nine miles through an unused gas pipeline](https://www.firstpost.com/world/how-a-gas-pipeline-helped-russia-mount-a-rear-strike-against-ukrainian-troops-in-kursk-13870078.html) to emerge behind Ukrainian formations. This caused panic and confusion among the Ukrainian formations who retreated, as larger Russian formations drove into the area from the west and east, threatening a complete encirclement.\n\nThe Ukrainians dispute this record of events, and have been backed up by the Institute for the Study of War, which told Western [media](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/media/) on Friday that it has “observed no geolocated evidence to indicate that Russian forces have encircled a significant number of Ukrainian forces” in Kursk or anywhere else along the frontline in Ukraine.\n\nNevertheless, if reports are true, it offers further proof of Russia’s penchant for encirclement, going back to World War II, and the [ encirclement of the German army](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/soviets-encircle-germans-at-stalingrad) outside of Stalingrad. All across the Ukrainian front line during 2024, Russian forces have mounted a series of small tactical encirclements to capture villages and towns. Pro-Russian military bloggers were gleeful that the Kursk encirclement was made possible by gas pipes that were empty because of Ukraine’s decision to\n\n[as of January 1.](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4glyjx9m71o)\n\n__halt Russian gas transit to Europe__Let’s be clear, Ukraine had been fighting hard to keep hold of the Kursk bridgehead as part of Zelensky’s land-trade gamble. This year saw a major Ukrainian counter-attack, following a build-up of military material from western donor nations. At best, this Ukrainian operation ended in a draw, with some Russian gains in the west of Kursk and some marginal Ukrainian gains north of Sudzha.\n\nEven if Ukraine had held onto its remaining bridgehead in Russia, it would have gone into any US-brokered peace talks in a weaker position than it was in August. In characteristic fashion, President Zelensky has this week been being [ throwing out chaff](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cgj5w6veqw6t) about President Putin avoiding the possibility of a peace deal. But, right now, and to echo President Trump’s words during their fated Oval Office meeting, he has the weakest hand of cards.\n\nU.S. Special Representative [ Steve Witkoff](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz6170w5jj5o) has announced that Presidents Trump and Putin may speak in the coming week. I assess that President Putin will go into that conversation ready to settle if he receives the assurances that he seeks.\n\nThe question for Washington is what incentive they can offer to Putin to line up behind a ceasefire? UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and European leaders have been advancing, frankly unworkable, ideas about [ tightening sanctions](https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/world/starmer-says-plans-for-military-support-for-ukraine-now-entering-operational-phase/ar-AA1AYXp1?ocid=BingNewsSerp) on Russia to force a settlement. But Putin will not agree to stand down his troops and face yet more sanctions having gained the upper hand. Anyone who believes that he will is, I am sorry to say, quite deluded.\n\n[. In possibly the most consequential ‘mm-hmm’ of this century, he offered the strongest signal that Ukrainian membership of the military alliance may now have been taken off the table. This is Russia’s top ask of any peace process. If President Trump makes that offer explicit and unequivocal, then I judge that President Putin would embrace a ceasefire and peace talks.](https://www.msn.com/en-gb/money/video/nato-s-rutte-on-trump-defense-spending-russia-relations/vi-AA1AV5Z6)\n\n__interview with Bloomberg__"

It was the first time a foreign army had occupied Russian land since the second world war.\n\nRussia, with the help of North Korean troops, has been pushing Ukrainian forces back, and in recent weeks the pressure on Ukrainian positions has become overwhelming. On Wednesday, Vladimir Putin donned military fatigues to visit a command post in the region, and on Thursday, Russia announced it had regained full control of Sudzha.\n\nWhile Ukrainian troops continue to hold a few remaining villages in Kursk, soldiers involved in the operation said it was probably only a matter of time before the retreat was concluded.\n\n“The Russians are already pushing into Sumy region [in Ukraine], all the tasks now are defensive,” said Serhiy, a special operations commander who recently left the region.\n\nThe demand by Putin that troops create a “buffer zone” close to the border suggests a Russian offensive pushing back into Ukraine may be on the cards, and authorities have already evacuated several settlements close to the border.\n\nThe end of the seven-month operation has led to mixed assessments in Ukraine, with some saying it achieved many of its goals, and others wondering if it was a distraction from the main war effort and cost Ukrainian lives for no tangible gain.\n\n“Kursk displaced the conflict on to Russian territory, and Russia used some of its best units to fight for it, but it also required a sizeable number of Ukraine’s elite units to hold the pocket,” said Michael Kofman, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nNow, the Russian offensive may change the dynamic of the war again, at a moment when the US is pushing Moscow and Kyiv to sign a ceasefire agreement. “My worry is that this gives the Kremlin and the Russian army a new bout of enthusiasm and adrenaline,” the Kyiv-based political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko said.\n\nThe [initial incursion into Kursk](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/03/ukrainian-troops-audacious-incursion-russia-kursk) happened last August. It was planned by a very small circle to retain an element of surprise, and Kyiv did not even brief western allies until after the operation was under way. Troops arrived in nearby Sumy in small groups, and many stayed in rented apartments.\n\n[Documents recovered from Russian army positions](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/20/revealed-russia-anticipated-kursk-incursion-months-in-advance-seized-papers-show) showed that Moscow’s military planners had warned of the threat of an incursion for months, but when it came Ukrainian troops were able to overrun Russian positions, taking hundreds of prisoners of war.\n\nIn Sudzha, officials and police fled without even destroying or taking away sensitive documents, leaving them for Ukrainian troops to seize and send to Kyiv for analysis.\n\nThose with knowledge of the planning say Ukrainian officials were taken aback by just how well the initial stage of the operation went, as Ukraine took control of about 500 sq miles within a few days.\n\n“At the beginning, the idea was just to create a diversion and to draw troops away from Donbas. But it went better than expected and suddenly we were digging in,” said one source.\n\n“We have no wish to occupy this territory,” Zelenskyy’s aide Mykhailo Podolyak told the Guardian in late August. “Our tasks are to push Russian artillery and other systems further away, destroy the warehouses and other military infrastructure that is there, and also to affect public opinion in Russia.”\n\nFor the first time in the war, the shoe was on the other foot and Ukraine became an occupying power. The Ukrainian army took journalists on tours of Sudzha, where stunned residents could not believe the war they had seen on their television screens had arrived on Russian territory. A historian from Sumy [recorded a podcast](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/07/ukraine-sudzha-russian-town-kursk-region) in Sudzha’s small history museum, explaining how Sudzha and the rest of the region was historically Ukrainian land, a nod to Russian claims about Ukrainian territories.\n\nAt one point, there were plans to ask Russians who were fighting alongside Ukraine to enter the region and take over police functions. The idea would have been to troll Russia, which masked its 2014 intervention in Donbas as the work of Ukrainian separatists. However, the plans were quickly discarded as unworkable and incendiary.\n\nThe capture of hundreds of prisoners allowed Ukraine to offer an exchange for captured Ukrainians held in Russian jails, and the operation was also credited with providing a morale boost to Ukrainian troops and society after months of setbacks.\n\nThe longer Ukrainian troops held on to the land, the more it became clear that the endgame of the operation was now the chance to use Kursk as a card at future negotiations. Zelenskyy [told](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/11/zelenskyy-europe-cannot-guarantee-ukraines-security-without-america) the Guardian last month that Kyiv would “swap one territory for another”.\n\nHowever, as time went on, Russia upped the pressure on Ukrainian positions in the region. By the beginning of this year, Ukrainian military planners could see Russia making a sustained effort to concentrate forces on Kursk.\n\n“Everything is going to Kursk,” one military source said in early February. “At the beginning they didn’t seem to pay that much attention to it, but then the North Koreans came, and then since the beginning of the year they are throwing everything at Kursk, perhaps to try to take it back before negotiating.”\n\nSome of Russia’s best drone units were relocated to the Kursk theatre. Because Ukrainian forces can use radio jammers to block Russian FPV (first person view) drones, Russia has increasingly begun using fibre optic drones, which unspool a thin cable over several miles and are immune to jammers.\n\n“The fields we are retreating through are like a spider’s web with all the fibre optic cables,” said Serhiy, the special operations commander.\n\nHe criticised the failure to build nets around the main road between Sumy and Sudzha to protect it from drones, as the Russians have done in part of the front in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region. “Only in the last two weeks they started trying to do this, but now it’s too dangerous. They should have done it in September, October, when everything was calm,” he said.\n\nUkrainian officials say that while ultimately the operation will not provide the hoped-for bargaining chip, it was able to change the narrative of the war, at a time when gloominess over Ukrainian prospects for any kind of advance had set in. They say that while the withdrawal may be fraught, it has so far passed without enormous loss of life or stubbornly holding on to undefendable positions.\n\n“After seven months, we simply withdrew. There was no encirclement,” said one senior security official, painting the operation as a success. “There were political goals, military goals, there was getting the Russians to move troops from Pokrovsk [in Donetsk] to Kursk. And we showed how shameful it is for the Russians, that they can’t fight Ukraine without North Koreans.”\n\nOthers had a more mixed assessment, noting that the offensive stretched Ukraine’s already understaffed forces, and did not slow the Russian advance in the east. “Tactically it was successful, but the offensive changed little in the overall dynamic of this war, and failed to achieve its wider operational objectives,” Kofman said."

It was the first time a foreign army had occupied Russian land since the second world war.\\n\\nRussia, with the help of North Korean troops, has been pushing Ukrainian forces back, and in recent weeks the pressure on Ukrainian positions has become overwhelming. On Wednesday, Vladimir Putin donned military fatigues to visit a command post in the region, and on Thursday, Russia announced it had regained full control of Sudzha.\\n\\nWhile Ukrainian troops continue to hold a few remaining villages in Kursk, soldiers involved in the operation said it was probably only a matter of time before the retreat was concluded.\\n\\n\\u201cThe Russians are already pushing into Sumy region [in Ukraine], all the tasks now are defensive,\\u201d said Serhiy, a special operations commander who recently left the region.\\n\\nThe demand by Putin that troops create a \\u201cbuffer zone\\u201d close to the border suggests a Russian offensive pushing back into Ukraine may be on the cards, and authorities have already evacuated several settlements close to the border.\\n\\nThe end of the seven-month operation has led to mixed assessments in Ukraine, with some saying it achieved many of its goals, and others wondering if it was a distraction from the main war effort and cost Ukrainian lives for no tangible gain.\\n\\n\\u201cKursk displaced the conflict on to Russian territory, and Russia used some of its best units to fight for it, but it also required a sizeable number of Ukraine\\u2019s elite units to hold the pocket,\\u201d said Michael Kofman, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\\n\\nNow, the Russian offensive may change the dynamic of the war again, at a moment when the US is pushing Moscow and Kyiv to sign a ceasefire agreement. \\u201cMy worry is that this gives the Kremlin and the Russian army a new bout of enthusiasm and adrenaline,\\u201d the Kyiv-based political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko said.\\n\\nThe [initial incursion into Kursk](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/03/ukrainian-troops-audacious-incursion-russia-kursk) happened last August. It was planned by a very small circle to retain an element of surprise, and Kyiv did not even brief western allies until after the operation was under way. Troops arrived in nearby Sumy in small groups, and many stayed in rented apartments.\\n\\n[Documents recovered from Russian army positions](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/20/revealed-russia-anticipated-kursk-incursion-months-in-advance-seized-papers-show) showed that Moscow\\u2019s military planners had warned of the threat of an incursion for months, but when it came Ukrainian troops were able to overrun Russian positions, taking hundreds of prisoners of war.\\n\\nIn Sudzha, officials and police fled without even destroying or taking away sensitive documents, leaving them for Ukrainian troops to seize and send to Kyiv for analysis.\\n\\nThose with knowledge of the planning say Ukrainian officials were taken aback by just how well the initial stage of the operation went, as Ukraine took control of about 500 sq miles within a few days.\\n\\n\\u201cAt the beginning, the idea was just to create a diversion and to draw troops away from Donbas. But it went better than expected and suddenly we were digging in,\\u201d said one source.\\n\\n\\u201cWe have no wish to occupy this territory,\\u201d Zelenskyy\\u2019s aide Mykhailo Podolyak told the Guardian in late August. \\u201cOur tasks are to push Russian artillery and other systems further away, destroy the warehouses and other military infrastructure that is there, and also to affect public opinion in Russia.\\u201d\\n\\nFor the first time in the war, the shoe was on the other foot and Ukraine became an occupying power. The Ukrainian army took journalists on tours of Sudzha, where stunned residents could not believe the war they had seen on their television screens had arrived on Russian territory.

Prior to the past week, based on the Institute for the Study of War [ battle map](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/36a7f6a6f5a9448496de641cf64bd375), Russia had already occupied three-to-four times more land in Ukraine than was seized in Kursk.\n\nOver the past 11 years, I have witnessed Russia’s preference for upping the military ante to put themselves in the strongest possible position before striking a deal. What has happened over the past week has been, in many respects, a carbon copy of the tactics Russia used immediately before the agreement of the Minsk 1 and Minsk 2 peace deals.\n\nAfter the separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk seized power following the February 2014 ouster of President Yanukovych, the Ukrainian army launched an Anti-Terror Operation to regain control of the Donbas. This led to considerable success on the Ukrainian side and the recapture of several large towns. With Ukrainian forces reaching the outskirts of Luhansk and Donetsk cities, the Russian military stepped into the conflict. On August 29, 2014, Russian formations encircled the town of Ilovaisk, inflicting a [ bloody defeat](about:blank) on the Ukrainian formations who are thought to have lost up to four hundred personnel. Just days later, the First Minsk agreement was signed, offering concessions to the separatists in the form of progress towards devolution.\n\nThe Ukrainian side didn’t push forward with devolution or a promised ‘national dialogue’. While the line of contact largely held, there were repeated violations of the ceasefire and casualties on both sides, including civilian casualties in the separatist areas which were verified by the [ OSCE Special Monitoring Mission](https://www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/121431).

This caused panic and confusion among the Ukrainian formations who retreated, as larger Russian formations drove into the area from the west and east, threatening a complete encirclement.\n\nThe Ukrainians dispute this record of events, and have been backed up by the Institute for the Study of War, which told Western [media](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/media/) on Friday that it has “observed no geolocated evidence to indicate that Russian forces have encircled a significant number of Ukrainian forces” in Kursk or anywhere else along the frontline in Ukraine.\n\nNevertheless, if reports are true, it offers further proof of Russia’s penchant for encirclement, going back to World War II, and the [ encirclement of the German army](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/soviets-encircle-germans-at-stalingrad) outside of Stalingrad. All across the Ukrainian front line during 2024, Russian forces have mounted a series of small tactical encirclements to capture villages and towns.

This year saw a major Ukrainian counter-attack, following a build-up of military material from western donor nations. At best, this Ukrainian operation ended in a draw, with some Russian gains in the west of Kursk and some marginal Ukrainian gains north of Sudzha.\n\nEven if Ukraine had held onto its remaining bridgehead in Russia, it would have gone into any US-brokered peace talks in a weaker position than it was in August. In characteristic fashion, President Zelensky has this week been being [ throwing out chaff](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cgj5w6veqw6t) about President Putin avoiding the possibility of a peace deal. But, right now, and to echo President Trump’s words during their fated Oval Office meeting, he has the weakest hand of cards.\n\nU.S. Special Representative [ Steve Witkoff](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz6170w5jj5o) has announced that Presidents Trump and Putin may speak in the coming week.

But Putin will not agree to stand down his troops and face yet more sanctions having gained the upper hand. Anyone who believes that he will is, I am sorry to say, quite deluded.\n\n[. In possibly the most consequential ‘mm-hmm’ of this century, he offered the strongest signal that Ukrainian membership of the military alliance may now have been taken off the table. This is Russia’s top ask of any peace process. If President Trump makes that offer explicit and unequivocal, then I judge that President Putin would embrace a ceasefire and peace talks.](https://www.msn.com/en-gb/money/video/nato-s-rutte-on-trump-defense-spending-russia-relations/vi-AA1AV5Z6)\n\n__interview with Bloomberg__"

With Ukrainian forces reaching the outskirts of Luhansk and Donetsk cities, the Russian military stepped into the conflict. On August 29, 2014, Russian formations encircled the town of Ilovaisk, inflicting a [ bloody defeat](about:blank) on the Ukrainian formations who are thought to have lost up to four hundred personnel. Just days later, the First Minsk agreement was signed, offering concessions to the separatists in the form of progress towards devolution.\\n\\nThe Ukrainian side didn\\u2019t push forward with devolution or a promised \\u2018national dialogue\\u2019. While the line of contact largely held, there were repeated violations of the ceasefire and casualties on both sides, including civilian casualties in the separatist areas which were verified by the [ OSCE Special Monitoring Mission](https://www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/121431). In late January 2015, Russian backed Wagner troops mounted a brutal and, ultimately, successful encirclement of the town of\\n\\n[, causing a withdrawal of Ukrainian troops.](https://archive.smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/battle-debaltseve-hybrid-army-classic-battle-encirclement)\\n\\n__Debaltseve__This battle of Debaltseve precipitated the negotiations in Minsk on February 11-12 to agree to the [ second Minsk agreement](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/05/minsk-conundrum-western-policy-and-russias-war-eastern-ukraine-0/minsk-2-agreement), with Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande at the talks.

According to reports, several hundred Russian troops [ crawled around nine miles through an unused gas pipeline](https://www.firstpost.com/world/how-a-gas-pipeline-helped-russia-mount-a-rear-strike-against-ukrainian-troops-in-kursk-13870078.html) to emerge behind Ukrainian formations. This caused panic and confusion among the Ukrainian formations who retreated, as larger Russian formations drove into the area from the west and east, threatening a complete encirclement.\\n\\nThe Ukrainians dispute this record of events, and have been backed up by the Institute for the Study of War, which told Western [media](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/media/) on Friday that it has \\u201cobserved no geolocated evidence to indicate that Russian forces have encircled a significant number of Ukrainian forces\\u201d in Kursk or anywhere else along the frontline in Ukraine.\\n\\nNevertheless, if reports are true, it offers further proof of Russia\\u2019s penchant for encirclement, going back to World War II, and the [ encirclement of the German army](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/soviets-encircle-germans-at-stalingrad) outside of Stalingrad. All across the Ukrainian front line during 2024, Russian forces have mounted a series of small tactical encirclements to capture villages and towns. Pro-Russian military bloggers were gleeful that the Kursk encirclement was made possible by gas pipes that were empty because of Ukraine\\u2019s decision to\\n\\n[as of January 1.](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4glyjx9m71o)\\n\\n__halt Russian gas transit to Europe__Let\\u2019s be clear, Ukraine had been fighting hard to keep hold of the Kursk bridgehead as part of Zelensky\\u2019s land-trade gamble. This year saw a major Ukrainian counter-attack, following a build-up of military material from western donor nations. At best, this Ukrainian operation ended in a draw, with some Russian gains in the west of Kursk and some marginal Ukrainian gains north of Sudzha.\\n\\nEven if Ukraine had held onto its remaining bridgehead in Russia, it would have gone into any US-brokered peace talks in a weaker position than it was in August. In characteristic fashion, President Zelensky has this week been being [ throwing out chaff](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cgj5w6veqw6t) about President Putin avoiding the possibility of a peace deal. But, right now, and to echo President Trump\\u2019s words during their fated Oval Office meeting, he has the weakest hand of cards.\\n\\nU.S. Special Representative [ Steve Witkoff](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz6170w5jj5o) has announced that Presidents Trump and Putin may speak in the coming week. I assess that President Putin will go into that conversation ready to settle if he receives the assurances that he seeks.\\n\\nThe question for Washington is what incentive they can offer to Putin to line up behind a ceasefire? UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and European leaders have been advancing, frankly unworkable, ideas about [ tightening sanctions](https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/world/starmer-says-plans-for-military-support-for-ukraine-now-entering-operational-phase/ar-AA1AYXp1?ocid=BingNewsSerp) on Russia to force a settlement. But Putin will not agree to stand down his troops and face yet more sanctions having gained the upper hand. Anyone who believes that he will is, I am sorry to say, quite deluded.\\n\\n[. In possibly the most consequential \\u2018mm-hmm\\u2019 of this century, he offered the strongest signal that Ukrainian membership of the military alliance may now have been taken off the table. This is Russia\\u2019s top ask of any peace process. If President Trump makes that offer explicit and unequivocal, then I judge that President Putin would embrace a ceasefire and peace talks.](https://www.msn.com/en-gb/money/video/nato-s-rutte-on-trump-defense-spending-russia-relations/vi-AA1AV5Z6)\\n\\n__interview with Bloomberg__\"}",

It was the first time a foreign army had occupied Russian land since the second world war.\\n\\nRussia, with the help of North Korean troops, has been pushing Ukrainian forces back, and in recent weeks the pressure on Ukrainian positions has become overwhelming. On Wednesday, Vladimir Putin donned military fatigues to visit a command post in the region, and on Thursday, Russia announced it had regained full control of Sudzha.\\n\\nWhile Ukrainian troops continue to hold a few remaining villages in Kursk, soldiers involved in the operation said it was probably only a matter of time before the retreat was concluded.\\n\\n\\u201cThe Russians are already pushing into Sumy region [in Ukraine], all the tasks now are defensive,\\u201d said Serhiy, a special operations commander who recently left the region.\\n\\nThe demand by Putin that troops create a \\u201cbuffer zone\\u201d close to the border suggests a Russian offensive pushing back into Ukraine may be on the cards, and authorities have already evacuated several settlements close to the border.\\n\\nThe end of the seven-month operation has led to mixed assessments in Ukraine, with some saying it achieved many of its goals, and others wondering if it was a distraction from the main war effort and cost Ukrainian lives for no tangible gain.\\n\\n\\u201cKursk displaced the conflict on to Russian territory, and Russia used some of its best units to fight for it, but it also required a sizeable number of Ukraine\\u2019s elite units to hold the pocket,\\u201d said Michael Kofman, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\\n\\nNow, the Russian offensive may change the dynamic of the war again, at a moment when the US is pushing Moscow and Kyiv to sign a ceasefire agreement. \\u201cMy worry is that this gives the Kremlin and the Russian army a new bout of enthusiasm and adrenaline,\\u201d the Kyiv-based political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko said.\\n\\nThe [initial incursion into Kursk](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/03/ukrainian-troops-audacious-incursion-russia-kursk) happened last August. It was planned by a very small circle to retain an element of surprise, and Kyiv did not even brief western allies until after the operation was under way. Troops arrived in nearby Sumy in small groups, and many stayed in rented apartments.\\n\\n[Documents recovered from Russian army positions](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/20/revealed-russia-anticipated-kursk-incursion-months-in-advance-seized-papers-show) showed that Moscow\\u2019s military planners had warned of the threat of an incursion for months, but when it came Ukrainian troops were able to overrun Russian positions, taking hundreds of prisoners of war.\\n\\nIn Sudzha, officials and police fled without even destroying or taking away sensitive documents, leaving them for Ukrainian troops to seize and send to Kyiv for analysis.\\n\\nThose with knowledge of the planning say Ukrainian officials were taken aback by just how well the initial stage of the operation went, as Ukraine took control of about 500 sq miles within a few days.\\n\\n\\u201cAt the beginning, the idea was just to create a diversion and to draw troops away from Donbas. But it went better than expected and suddenly we were digging in,\\u201d said one source.\\n\\n\\u201cWe have no wish to occupy this territory,\\u201d Zelenskyy\\u2019s aide Mykhailo Podolyak told the Guardian in late August. \\u201cOur tasks are to push Russian artillery and other systems further away, destroy the warehouses and other military infrastructure that is there, and also to affect public opinion in Russia.\\u201d\\n\\nFor the first time in the war, the shoe was on the other foot and Ukraine became an occupying power. The Ukrainian army took journalists on tours of Sudzha, where stunned residents could not believe the war they had seen on their television screens had arrived on Russian territory. A historian from Sumy [recorded a podcast](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/07/ukraine-sudzha-russian-town-kursk-region) in Sudzha\\u2019s small history museum, explaining how Sudzha and the rest of the region was historically Ukrainian land, a nod to Russian claims about Ukrainian territories.\\n\\nAt one point, there were plans to ask Russians who were fighting alongside Ukraine to enter the region and take over police functions. The idea would have been to troll Russia, which masked its 2014 intervention in Donbas as the work of Ukrainian separatists. However, the plans were quickly discarded as unworkable and incendiary.\\n\\nThe capture of hundreds of prisoners allowed Ukraine to offer an exchange for captured Ukrainians held in Russian jails, and the operation was also credited with providing a morale boost to Ukrainian troops and society after months of setbacks.\\n\\nThe longer Ukrainian troops held on to the land, the more it became clear that the endgame of the operation was now the chance to use Kursk as a card at future negotiations. Zelenskyy [told](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/11/zelenskyy-europe-cannot-guarantee-ukraines-security-without-america) the Guardian last month that Kyiv would \\u201cswap one territory for another\\u201d.\\n\\nHowever, as time went on, Russia upped the pressure on Ukrainian positions in the region. By the beginning of this year, Ukrainian military planners could see Russia making a sustained effort to concentrate forces on Kursk.\\n\\n\\u201cEverything is going to Kursk,\\u201d one military source said in early February. \\u201cAt the beginning they didn\\u2019t seem to pay that much attention to it, but then the North Koreans came, and then since the beginning of the year they are throwing everything at Kursk, perhaps to try to take it back before negotiating.\\u201d\\n\\nSome of Russia\\u2019s best drone units were relocated to the Kursk theatre. Because Ukrainian forces can use radio jammers to block Russian FPV (first person view) drones, Russia has increasingly begun using fibre optic drones, which unspool a thin cable over several miles and are immune to jammers.\\n\\n\\u201cThe fields we are retreating through are like a spider\\u2019s web with all the fibre optic cables,\\u201d said Serhiy, the special operations commander.\\n\\nHe criticised the failure to build nets around the main road between Sumy and Sudzha to protect it from drones, as the Russians have done in part of the front in Ukraine\\u2019s eastern Donbas region. \\u201cOnly in the last two weeks they started trying to do this, but now it\\u2019s too dangerous. They should have done it in September, October, when everything was calm,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nUkrainian officials say that while ultimately the operation will not provide the hoped-for bargaining chip, it was able to change the narrative of the war, at a time when gloominess over Ukrainian prospects for any kind of advance had set in. They say that while the withdrawal may be fraught, it has so far passed without enormous loss of life or stubbornly holding on to undefendable positions.\\n\\n\\u201cAfter seven months, we simply withdrew. There was no encirclement,\\u201d said one senior security official, painting the operation as a success. \\u201cThere were political goals, military goals, there was getting the Russians to move troops from Pokrovsk [in Donetsk] to Kursk. And we showed how shameful it is for the Russians, that they can\\u2019t fight Ukraine without North Koreans.\\u201d\\n\\nOthers had a more mixed assessment, noting that the offensive stretched Ukraine\\u2019s already understaffed forces, and did not slow the Russian advance in the east. \\u201cTactically it was successful, but the offensive changed little in the overall dynamic of this war, and failed to achieve its wider operational objectives,\\u201d Kofman said.\"}",

It is absolutely clear to me that for President Putin, retaking Kursk was essential to putting him in the best possible place to negotiate.\\n\\nZelensky had gambled on improving his hand of cards in future ceasefire talks by being able to trade land in [Russia](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/tag/russia/) for the return of land in Ukraine. That gamble has failed. Prior to the past week, based on the Institute for the Study of War [ battle map](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/36a7f6a6f5a9448496de641cf64bd375), Russia had already occupied three-to-four times more land in Ukraine than was seized in Kursk.\\n\\nOver the past 11 years, I have witnessed Russia\\u2019s preference for upping the military ante to put themselves in the strongest possible position before striking a deal. What has happened over the past week has been, in many respects, a carbon copy of the tactics Russia used immediately before the agreement of the Minsk 1 and Minsk 2 peace deals.\\n\\nAfter the separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk seized power following the February 2014 ouster of President Yanukovych, the Ukrainian army launched an Anti-Terror Operation to regain control of the Donbas. This led to considerable success on the Ukrainian side and the recapture of several large towns. With Ukrainian forces reaching the outskirts of Luhansk and Donetsk cities, the Russian military stepped into the conflict. On August 29, 2014, Russian formations encircled the town of Ilovaisk, inflicting a [ bloody defeat](about:blank) on the Ukrainian formations who are thought to have lost up to four hundred personnel. Just days later, the First Minsk agreement was signed, offering concessions to the separatists in the form of progress towards devolution.\\n\\nThe Ukrainian side didn\\u2019t push forward with devolution or a promised \\u2018national dialogue\\u2019. While the line of contact largely held, there were repeated violations of the ceasefire and casualties on both sides, including civilian casualties in the separatist areas which were verified by the [ OSCE Special Monitoring Mission](https://www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/121431).

This caused panic and confusion among the Ukrainian formations who retreated, as larger Russian formations drove into the area from the west and east, threatening a complete encirclement.\\n\\nThe Ukrainians dispute this record of events, and have been backed up by the Institute for the Study of War, which told Western [media](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/media/) on Friday that it has \\u201cobserved no geolocated evidence to indicate that Russian forces have encircled a significant number of Ukrainian forces\\u201d in Kursk or anywhere else along the frontline in Ukraine.\\n\\nNevertheless, if reports are true, it offers further proof of Russia\\u2019s penchant for encirclement, going back to World War II, and the [ encirclement of the German army](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/soviets-encircle-germans-at-stalingrad) outside of Stalingrad. All across the Ukrainian front line during 2024, Russian forces have mounted a series of small tactical encirclements to capture villages and towns.

This year saw a major Ukrainian counter-attack, following a build-up of military material from western donor nations. At best, this Ukrainian operation ended in a draw, with some Russian gains in the west of Kursk and some marginal Ukrainian gains north of Sudzha.\\n\\nEven if Ukraine had held onto its remaining bridgehead in Russia, it would have gone into any US-brokered peace talks in a weaker position than it was in August. In characteristic fashion, President Zelensky has this week been being [ throwing out chaff](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cgj5w6veqw6t) about President Putin avoiding the possibility of a peace deal. But, right now, and to echo President Trump\\u2019s words during their fated Oval Office meeting, he has the weakest hand of cards.\\n\\nU.S. Special Representative [ Steve Witkoff](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz6170w5jj5o) has announced that Presidents Trump and Putin may speak in the coming week. I assess that President Putin will go into that conversation ready to settle if he receives the assurances that he seeks.\\n\\nThe question for Washington is what incentive they can offer to Putin to line up behind a ceasefire? UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and European leaders have been advancing, frankly unworkable, ideas about [ tightening sanctions](https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/world/starmer-says-plans-for-military-support-for-ukraine-now-entering-operational-phase/ar-AA1AYXp1?ocid=BingNewsSerp) on Russia to force a settlement. But Putin will not agree to stand down his troops and face yet more sanctions having gained the upper hand. Anyone who believes that he will is, I am sorry to say, quite deluded.\\n\\n[. In possibly the most consequential \\u2018mm-hmm\\u2019 of this century, he offered the strongest signal that Ukrainian membership of the military alliance may now have been taken off the table. This is Russia\\u2019s top ask of any peace process. If President Trump makes that offer explicit and unequivocal, then I judge that President Putin would embrace a ceasefire and peace talks.](https://www.msn.com/en-gb/money/video/nato-s-rutte-on-trump-defense-spending-russia-relations/vi-AA1AV5Z6)\\n\\n__interview with Bloomberg__\"}",

      "content": "Based on the gathered evidence, the situation in the Kursk region as of mid-March 2025 indicates that Ukrainian forces have largely retreated from the area. Key points from the evidence include:\n\n1. **Ukrainian Retreat**: Ukrainian forces have pulled almost entirely out of the Kursk region, with reports indicating that they are holding only a small portion of the territory they previously controlled. By March 16, 2025, they were clinging to barely 30 square miles along the Russia-Ukraine border.\n\n2. **Russian Control**: Russian forces have reportedly regained full control of key areas such as the town of Sudzha. There are reports of successful Russian encirclement operations causing Ukrainian forces to retreat.\n\n3. **Strategic Context**: The retreat appears to be part of a broader strategic withdrawal by Ukraine, possibly influenced by ongoing geopolitical negotiations and the pressure from Russian and allied forces.\n\n4. **ISW Assessment**: The Institute for the Study of War has not confirmed significant encirclement of Ukrainian forces, suggesting some dispute over the extent of Russian control, but the overall trend indicates a strong Russian presence.\n\nGiven these factors, it seems likely that by March 31, 2025, the ISW warmap could show Kursk as having been completely retaken by Russia, as Ukrainian forces have been significantly pushed back and are in retreat.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.85"
