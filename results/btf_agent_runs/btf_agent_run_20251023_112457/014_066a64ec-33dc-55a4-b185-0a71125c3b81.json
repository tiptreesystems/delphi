  "question": "Will S&P 500 recover half its drop by April 7, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.25,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here are the key points relevant to assessing the probability of the S&P 500 recovering half its drop by April 7, 2025:\n\n1. **Current Market Conditions**:\n   - As of March 19, 2025, the S&P 500 closed at 5675.35. The forecast for March 2025 predicts a maximum value of 6241, but the expected close is 5581, indicating a continued downward trend for the month.\n   - The forecast for April 2025 predicts a maximum value of 6005, but the expected close is 5488, suggesting limited recovery potential in the near term.\n\n2. **Economic Indicators**:\n   - Tariffs and trade policy uncertainties have led to market instability, with investors shifting to defensive stocks and safe-haven assets.\n   - Inflation has moderated slightly, which could lead to potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, but the Fed has not signaled immediate plans for substantial rate cuts.\n   - Consumer sentiment has weakened, and the yield curve has shown signs of inversion, both of which are concerning indicators for economic growth and market recovery.\n\n3. **Market Sentiment**:\n   - The market is experiencing volatility due to President Trump's on-again, off-again tariffs, impacting investor confidence.\n   - The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) is elevated, indicating heightened market concern, although not at crisis levels.\n\n4. **Analyst Forecasts**:\n   - Goldman Sachs has lowered its forecast for the S&P 500 to hit 6,200 by the end of 2025, down from 6,500, due to uncertainty around tariffs and economic growth.\n   - The S&P 500 futures showed some positive sentiment with a rise on March 12, 2025, but overall market conditions remain challenging.\n\nGiven these factors, the probability of the S&P 500 recovering to at least $5,858.11 by April 7, 2025, seems low. The forecasts and current market conditions suggest limited upside potential in the short term, with ongoing economic and policy uncertainties weighing on investor sentiment.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.25",

Divining between news that identifies a paradigm shift that will either positively or negatively affect earnings (signal) versus news that garners a lot of attention yet will not meaningfully impact a company’s business (noise).\n\nOnly two months into the year and it already feels like we have had a full year’s worth of headlines. From earnings and guidance, to the DeepSeek scare, to President Donald Trump’s on-again, off-again tariffs, volatility has risen anew.\n\nIn such an environment, what’s an investor to do? Investors should focus on the fundamentals, maintain a long-term mindset, and pay attention to valuations. And that is just what our analyst team is doing, scrutinizing the long-term fundamentals underlying sector outlooks and analyzing the long-term assumptions that drive our valuation models. Considering how fluid the situation remains as to the threats of implementing tariffs, once we have specificity on the amount of tariffs that will be implemented and a base case as to how long those tariffs may last, we will adjust our projections and valuations accordingly.\n\n## US Stock Market Valuation and Outlook\n\nAs of Feb. 28, 2025, according to a composite of our valuations, the US stock market was trading at about a 1% discount to fair value. That was the first time since a year ago (when stocks pulled back following inflation data that led to a shift in interest-rate expectations) the market has traded at a discount to a composite of our fair values.\n\n## Value Is Significantly Outperforming…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 375 words out of ~1399.

A number of one-off drags weighed on the month: The LA wildfires, a bad flu season, and (likely having the largest impact) severe winter weather across much of the continental United States. Even as these headwinds faded in February, new drags appeared. The DOGE cuts to federal headcount and suspended payments for federal programs pushed up jobless claims, and will likely translate to a 250,000 to 500,000 cumulative drag on payroll growth in the next six months. Consumer sentiment jumped after the election, but reversed and weakened in January and February. The University of Michigan’s consumer survey (Which breaks out sentiment by political affiliation) shows the drop is concentrated among Democrat-leaning consumers, who are the most downbeat since 2008. Republican-leaning sentiment is considerably better. But even surveys whose respondents lean right show growing concern about economic uncertainty, in particular related to higher tariffs. The tariff increases proposed in February and March would be equivalent to a tax increase of between 0.5% and 1.0% of U.S. GDP, equivalent to about half of U.S. corporate tax receipts—in other words, a substantial hike. Whether they end up at those levels, higher, or lower, tariff hikes promise to raise prices in 2025 and 2026.\n\nInflation entered 2025 trending in the right direction. The core PCE index excluding food and energy slowed in January to the smallest year-over-year increase since March 2021. However, the Fed’s focus has shifted from the rear-looking data flow to the forward-looking outlook as tariffs raise goods prices, and as more aggressive immigration enforcement re…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 356 words out of ~771.

We asked Jana Grittersová, a UCR economist and associate professor of political science, to characterize the mindset of investors, and the relevance of various economic indicators. She is a former central banker at the National Bank of Slovakia and an economist at the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union.\n\n###### How does tariff uncertainty affect investors’ decision-making?\n\n**Grittersová:** Tariff uncertainty disrupts predictability, making it difficult for firms to forecast corporate earnings, supply chain costs, and global market demand. This uncertainty discourages expansion plans and new hiring. In a volatile tariff environment, investors demand higher returns for holding riskier assets, such as equities, particularly in sectors that rely on international trade. Instead, they shift their investments into defensive stocks, such as utilities or healthcare, as well as safe-haven assets, such as gold. As a result, the S&P 500—a stock market index that tracks the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States—has declined. At the same time, Europe’s Stoxx 600 (that covers the performance of 600 companies across 17 European countries) has risen by 12% (according to The Economist), driven by a weakening dollar and a surge in European defense stocks driven by expectations of higher defense spending by European countries. Overall, frequent shifts in trade policy contribute to an unstable business environment.\n\n###### At first, markets seem to bounce back immediately after a pro-trade Trump announcement, such as postponing threatened tariffs.

Divining between news that identifies a paradigm shift that will either positively or negatively affect earnings (signal) versus news that garners a lot of attention yet will not meaningfully impact a company\\u2019s business (noise).\\n\\nOnly two months into the year and it already feels like we have had a full year\\u2019s worth of headlines. From earnings and guidance, to the DeepSeek scare, to President Donald Trump\\u2019s on-again, off-again tariffs, volatility has risen anew.\\n\\nIn such an environment, what\\u2019s an investor to do? Investors should focus on the fundamentals, maintain a long-term mindset, and pay attention to valuations. And that is just what our analyst team is doing, scrutinizing the long-term fundamentals underlying sector outlooks and analyzing the long-term assumptions that drive our valuation models. Considering how fluid the situation remains as to the threats of implementing tariffs, once we have specificity on the amount of tariffs that will be implemented and a base case as to how long those tariffs may last, we will adjust our projections and valuations accordingly.\\n\\n## US Stock Market Valuation and Outlook\\n\\nAs of Feb. 28, 2025, according to a composite of our valuations, the US stock market was trading at about a 1% discount to fair value. That was the first time since a year ago (when stocks pulled back following inflation data that led to a shift in interest-rate expectations) the market has traded at a discount to a composite of our fair values.\\n\\n## Value Is Significantly Outperforming\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 375 words out of ~1399.

A number of one-off drags weighed on the month: The LA wildfires, a bad flu season, and (likely having the largest impact) severe winter weather across much of the continental United States. Even as these headwinds faded in February, new drags appeared. The DOGE cuts to federal headcount and suspended payments for federal programs pushed up jobless claims, and will likely translate to a 250,000 to 500,000 cumulative drag on payroll growth in the next six months. Consumer sentiment jumped after the election, but reversed and weakened in January and February. The University of Michigan\\u2019s consumer survey (Which breaks out sentiment by political affiliation) shows the drop is concentrated among Democrat-leaning consumers, who are the most downbeat since 2008. Republican-leaning sentiment is considerably better. But even surveys whose respondents lean right show growing concern about economic uncertainty, in particular related to higher tariffs. The tariff increases proposed in February and March would be equivalent to a tax increase of between 0.5% and 1.0% of U.S. GDP, equivalent to about half of U.S. corporate tax receipts\\u2014in other words, a substantial hike. Whether they end up at those levels, higher, or lower, tariff hikes promise to raise prices in 2025 and 2026.\\n\\nInflation entered 2025 trending in the right direction.

We asked Jana Grittersov\\u00e1, a UCR economist and associate professor of political science, to characterize the mindset of investors, and the relevance of various economic indicators. She is a former central banker at the National Bank of Slovakia and an economist at the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union.\\n\\n###### How does tariff uncertainty affect investors\\u2019 decision-making?\\n\\n**Grittersov\\u00e1:** Tariff uncertainty disrupts predictability, making it difficult for firms to forecast corporate earnings, supply chain costs, and global market demand. This uncertainty discourages expansion plans and new hiring. In a volatile tariff environment, investors demand higher returns for holding riskier assets, such as equities, particularly in sectors that rely on international trade. Instead, they shift their investments into defensive stocks, such as utilities or healthcare, as well as safe-haven assets, such as gold. As a result, the S&P 500\\u2014a stock market index that tracks the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States\\u2014has declined. At the same time, Europe\\u2019s Stoxx 600 (that covers the performance of 600 companies across 17 European countries) has risen by 12% (according to The Economist), driven by a weakening dollar and a surge in European defense stocks driven by expectations of higher defense spending by European countries. Overall, frequent shifts in trade policy contribute to an unstable business environment.\\n\\n###### At first, markets seem to bounce back immediately after a pro-trade Trump announcement, such as postponing threatened tariffs.

The forecast for March 2025 predicts a maximum value of 6241, but the expected close is 5581, indicating a continued downward trend for the month.\n   - The forecast for April 2025 predicts a maximum value of 6005, but the expected close is 5488, suggesting limited recovery potential in the near term.\n\n2. **Economic Indicators**:\n   - Tariffs and trade policy uncertainties have led to market instability, with investors shifting to defensive stocks and safe-haven assets.\n   - Inflation has moderated slightly, which could lead to potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, but the Fed has not signaled immediate plans for substantial rate cuts.\n   - Consumer sentiment has weakened, and the yield curve has shown signs of inversion, both of which are concerning indicators for economic growth and market recovery.\n\n3. **Market Sentiment**:\n   - The market is experiencing volatility due to President Trump's on-again, off-again tariffs, impacting investor confidence.\n   - The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) is elevated, indicating heightened market concern, although not at crisis levels.\n\n4. **Analyst Forecasts**:\n   - Goldman Sachs has lowered its forecast for the S&P 500 to hit 6,200 by the end of 2025, down from 6,500, due to uncertainty around tariffs and economic growth.\n   - The S&P 500 futures showed some positive sentiment with a rise on March 12, 2025, but overall market conditions remain challenging.\n\nGiven these factors, the probability of the S&P 500 recovering to at least $5,858.11 by April 7, 2025, seems low. The forecasts and current market conditions suggest limited upside potential in the short term, with ongoing economic and policy uncertainties weighing on investor sentiment.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.25"
