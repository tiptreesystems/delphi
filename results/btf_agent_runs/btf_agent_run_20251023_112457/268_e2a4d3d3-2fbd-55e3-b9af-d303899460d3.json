However, the exact temperature range for April 1, 2025, remains uncertain.\n\nConsidering the ongoing warming trend and the historical data, it's reasonable to estimate a moderate probability that the temperature will fall within the specified range of 14.3°C to 14.7°C, given the general trend of increasing temperatures.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.6",
