  "question": "Will Canada's petition to revoke Elon Musk's dual citizenship reach 1 million signatures before April 1, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.1,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here is a summary of the current status of the petition to revoke Elon Musk's Canadian citizenship:\n\n1. As of March 9, 2025, the petition had gathered 364,000 signatures. This is a significant increase from the 280,000 signatures reported on February 26, 2025.\n2. The petition is open for signatures until June 20, 2025, which allows more time for it to gather additional support.\n3. The petition is sponsored by Charlie Angus, a member of parliament from the New Democratic Party, which may lend it political credibility and visibility.\n4. There is strong public sentiment against Elon Musk in Canada, with 71% of Canadians supporting a ban on Tesla sales, indicating a potential for further growth in petition signatures.\n\nGiven the current number of signatures and the time remaining until the deadline for reaching 1 million signatures (April 1, 2025), it seems unlikely that the petition will achieve the required number of signatures in the remaining time. The growth rate would need to increase significantly to reach 1 million signatures in just over a week.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1",

The petition is open for signatures until June 20, 2025, which allows more time for it to gather additional support.\n3. The petition is sponsored by Charlie Angus, a member of parliament from the New Democratic Party, which may lend it political credibility and visibility.\n4. There is strong public sentiment against Elon Musk in Canada, with 71% of Canadians supporting a ban on Tesla sales, indicating a potential for further growth in petition signatures.\n\nGiven the current number of signatures and the time remaining until the deadline for reaching 1 million signatures (April 1, 2025), it seems unlikely that the petition will achieve the required number of signatures in the remaining time. The growth rate would need to increase significantly to reach 1 million signatures in just over a week.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1"
