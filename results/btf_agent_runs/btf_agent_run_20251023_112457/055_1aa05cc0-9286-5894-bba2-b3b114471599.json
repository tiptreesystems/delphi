  "question": "Will 900,000 Russian personnel losses be reported before March 21, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.95,
  "reasoning": "Based on the information gathered from various sources:\n\n1. As of February 25, 2025, the estimated Russian personnel losses are approximately 869,530 according to the [Index Minfin](https://index.minfin.com.ua/en/russian-invading/casualties/). This is an increase of 1,300 from the previous day, indicating a consistent daily increase in casualties.\n\n2. The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported on February 19, 2025, that the total Russian personnel losses were approximately 862,390, with a daily increase of 1,300 soldiers.\n\n3. The daily casualty rate has been consistently above 1,000 since July 25, 2024, and currently stands at about 1,300 per day.\n\nGiven the current rate of 1,300 casualties per day, and with the present total at approximately 869,530, it is likely that the 900,000 mark will be reached before March 21, 2025. The number of days remaining until March 21, 2025, is 24 days from February 25, 2025. At a rate of 1,300 casualties per day, this would add approximately 31,200 casualties, bringing the total to approximately 900,730 by March 20, 2025.\n\nTherefore, given the current trends and data, the probability that the reported Russian personnel losses will reach 900,000 before March 21, 2025, is very high.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.95",

This is roughly equivalent to the strength of nearly 36 motorized rifle divisions of the russian land forces. The total losses incurred by the enemy last year were more significant than those in 2022 and 2023.**\n\nThe month of December 2024 marked a record high for irrecoverable and sanitary casualties within the aggressor's troops, totaling 48,670 military personnel. This also marks the peak figure observed since the onset of the large-scale invasion. The previous large-scale figures of the russian army's military personnel losses were recorded in November 2024, when they amounted to 45,720.\n\nThe past year was also fruitful in terms of destroying enemy equipment. Warriors of the Ukrainian Defence Forces have destroyed and damaged 3,689 enemy tanks. This is roughly equivalent to the strength of 119 tank battalions. During May, the destruction of enemy tanks reached its highest point, with 428 vehicles being destroyed. According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, our military units destroyed 31 enemy tanks in a single day on May 12. This is equivalent to the number of vehicles in a tank battalion.\n\nLast year, our warriors destroyed and damaged 8,956 armored fighting vehicles of the russian army. This roughly equals the number of AFVs in over 37 motorized rifle divisions. The highest number of enemy armored vehicles destroyed or disabled was recorded in October 2024, totaling 923 vehicles. The cost of this quantity of destroyed AFVs in a single month to the aggressor country's budget is estimated to be at least half a billion U.S. dollars. The daily record was set on November 12, with 81 AFVs destroyed.\n\nLast year, Ukrainian warriors also incapacitated 13,050 units of enemy artillery systems.

At the same time the daily rate is being constantly above 1000 since July 25, 2024. With the pace of 1300 casualties per day the number of 900,000 casualties should be reached on March 20, 2025.\n\nHistorical data can be tracked by independent trackers\nsuch as [russian-casualties-in-ua](https://russian-casualties.in.ua/) , [Combat.FYI](https://combat.fyi/) and in the [2022-Ukraine-Russia-War-Dataset](https://github.com/PetroIvaniuk/2022-Ukraine-Russia-War-Dataset/blob/main/data/russia_losses_personnel.json).\nResolution criteria: This question will resolve as **Yes** if, before March 21, 2025, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reports 900,000 or more total Russian personnel losses on their [official site](https://mod.gov.ua/en/news?tags=Combat) or public media pages ([Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/GeneralStaff.ua), [Telegram](https://t.me/GeneralStaffZSU), [X.com](https://x.com/GeneralStaffUA)).\n\nIf all reports published before March 21, 2025 show numbers below 900,000, this question resolves as **No**. This includes the case when the General Staff of the AFU stops publishing their data due to a ceasefire or peace agreement.\nFine print: * \"Personnel losses\" in this context are *killed and wounded* soldiers and that wounded soldiers may return to the battlefield later.\n* In the past there was at least one occasion on [May 27, 2023](https://www.facebook.com/GeneralStaff.ua/posts/594141432898939?ref=embed_post) when the error in the previous day's report was admitted and corrected. For this reason, the question will resolve two days later than any published report, although it will retroactively close before the date the report was first published.\n* Historical trackers mentioned in the Background information ([russian-casualties-in-ua](https://russian-casualties.in.ua/), [Combat.FYI](https://combat.fyi/) and the [2022-Ukraine-Russia-War-Dataset](https://github.com/PetroIvaniuk/2022-Ukraine-Russia-War-Dataset/blob/main/data/russia_losses_personnel.json)) may be used as secondary resolution sources if the main resolution pages are banned/unavailable.\npresent_date: 2025-02-25T14:20:42.674117\n\n\nMake sure to use the tools at your disposal to gather relevant information before providing your final probability estimate.\n\nYou may reason through the problem, but you MUST end your response with:\nFINAL PROBABILITY: [your decimal number between 0 and 1]"

This is an increase of 1,300 from the previous day, indicating a consistent daily increase in casualties.\n\n2. The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported on February 19, 2025, that the total Russian personnel losses were approximately 862,390, with a daily increase of 1,300 soldiers.\n\n3. The daily casualty rate has been consistently above 1,000 since July 25, 2024, and currently stands at about 1,300 per day.\n\nGiven the current rate of 1,300 casualties per day, and with the present total at approximately 869,530, it is likely that the 900,000 mark will be reached before March 21, 2025. The number of days remaining until March 21, 2025, is 24 days from February 25, 2025. At a rate of 1,300 casualties per day, this would add approximately 31,200 casualties, bringing the total to approximately 900,730 by March 20, 2025.\n\nTherefore, given the current trends and data, the probability that the reported Russian personnel losses will reach 900,000 before March 21, 2025, is very high.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.95"
