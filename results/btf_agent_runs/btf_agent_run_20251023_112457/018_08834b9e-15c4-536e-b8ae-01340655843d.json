  "question": "Will the DC cherry trees reach peak bloom on or after April 1 in 2025?",
  "probability": 0.2,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here are the key points relevant to the question of whether the DC cherry trees will reach peak bloom on or after April 1 in 2025:\n\n1. **Forecasts for 2025**: \n   - The National Park Service (NPS) predicts the peak bloom for 2025 to occur between March 28 and 31.\n   - NBC StormTeam4 forecasts the peak bloom to occur between March 28 and April 3.\n   - The Washington Post predicts the peak bloom will occur between March 23 and 27.\n\n2. **Historical Data**:\n   - The average peak bloom date for Washington's cherry blossoms is April 3.\n   - Since 1921, peak bloom dates have shifted earlier by approximately eight days.\n   - In 15 of the past 20 years, the peak bloom date has occurred before April 3.\n\n3. **Current Conditions**:\n   - As of March 23, 2025, many trees are in the puffy white stage, indicating they are close to peak bloom but not yet there.\n   - Slightly cooler temperatures are expected, which could prolong the bloom period.\n\nGiven these points, the most authoritative prediction from the NPS suggests a peak bloom before April 1. However, the forecast by NBC StormTeam4 extends to April 3, introducing some uncertainty. Historical trends also suggest an earlier bloom, typically before April 3.\n\nConsidering all this information, the probability that the DC cherry trees will reach peak bloom on or after April 1 in 2025 is relatively low.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.2",

However, the forecast by NBC StormTeam4 extends to April 3, introducing some uncertainty. Historical trends also suggest an earlier bloom, typically before April 3.\n\nConsidering all this information, the probability that the DC cherry trees will reach peak bloom on or after April 1 in 2025 is relatively low.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.2"
