  "question": "Will Assassin's Creed Shadows rank between 8th and 9th on Steam's Weekly Top Sellers chart for March 18 - 25, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.3,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered information, here are the key points:\n\n1. **Pre-orders and Expectations**: \n   - As of February 18, 2025, \"Assassin's Creed Shadows\" had 300,000 pre-orders, which is solid but not quite at the level of \"Assassin's Creed Odyssey\" which had around 400,000-450,000 pre-orders before its release.\n   - Ubisoft has described the pre-orders as \"solid\" and in line with the series' second most successful entry, \"Assassin's Creed Odyssey\".\n\n2. **Current Rankings and Market Position**:\n   - As of March 13, 2025, \"Assassin's Creed Shadows\" was ranked #18 in top sellers on Steam, #49 in wishlists, and #15 in best sellers on the US PlayStation Network.\n   - The game is set to release on March 20, 2025, which means it will be eligible for the Steam Top Sellers chart during the week of March 18-25, 2025.\n\n3. **Market and Financial Context**:\n   - Ubisoft is facing financial difficulties, with a significant drop in stock price, making the success of this game crucial for the company.\n   - The game features a fan-favorite setting in feudal Japan, which could attract a wide audience, but there are controversies that might impact its reception in the U.S.\n\n4. **Potential for Success**:\n   - The game is expected to have a strong launch, potentially reaching 3.5 million copies sold by the end of the first month.\n   - However, its current ranking at #18 in top sellers on Steam suggests it might not reach the 8th or 9th position immediately upon release.\n\nGiven these factors, while \"Assassin's Creed Shadows\" is poised for a strong release and has significant pre-order numbers, its current position in the Steam top sellers and the competitive nature of new releases around its launch date suggest that it might not rank as high as 8th or 9th in the immediate week of its release.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.3",

If his information is correct, *Assassin’s Creed Shadows* would need to gain another 100,000-150,000 pre-orders over the next month to surpass *Assassin’s Creed Odyssey*.\n\nHenderson also noted that over the same period, *Star Wars Outlaws* was pre-ordered by half as many people as *Assassin’s Creed Shadows*.\n\nThe insider suggests that by the end of the first month, sales of *Assassin’s Creed Shadows* could reach 3.5 million copies.\n\nAccording to Henderson, Ubisoft has no intention of delaying the game's release any further. *Assassin’s Creed Shadows* is slated to launch on March 20, 2025, on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.\n\n### Source:\n\n[Insider Gaming](https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date/)"

According to them, as of today, the number of pre-orders for the game has reached 300,000 copies.\n\n*Assassin’s Creed Shadows*\n\nLast week, Ubisoft [announced](https://app2top.ru/news/kvartal-naya-vy-ruchka-ubisoft-ruhnula-v-dva-raza-no-assassin-s-creed-shadows-ochen-horosho-predzakazy-vayut-227615.html) that *Assassin’s Creed Shadows* could have the second-largest launch in the series' history. This record is currently held by *Assassin’s Creed Odyssey*. According to Henderson, on the eve of its release, \"Odyssey\" had around 400,000-450,000 pre-orders. If his information is correct, *Assassin’s Creed Shadows* would need to gain another 100,000-150,000 pre-orders over the next month to surpass *Assassin’s Creed Odyssey*.\n\nHenderson also noted that over the same period, *Star Wars Outlaws* was pre-ordered by half as many people as *Assassin’s Creed Shadows*.\n\nThe insider suggests that by the end of the first month, sales of *Assassin’s Creed Shadows* could reach 3.5 million copies.\n\nAccording to Henderson, Ubisoft has no intention of delaying the game's release any further. *Assassin’s Creed Shadows* is slated to launch on March 20, 2025, on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.\n\n### Source:\n\n[Insider Gaming](https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date/)",
