  "question": "Will Donald Trump sign more than 90 executive orders in February and March 2025?",
  "probability": 0.8,
  "reasoning": "Based on the evidence gathered from multiple sources, here is the analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Executive Order Count**: As of February 6, 2025, Donald Trump had signed 58 executive orders. This is a significant number, indicating a high pace of executive order issuance.\n\n2. **Historical Context**: Trump has historically signed a large number of executive orders in his initial months in office, surpassing previous presidents. This trend seems to continue in 2025.\n\n3. **Recent Activity**: In March 2025, there has been a high frequency of executive orders being signed, with multiple orders signed on a single day, such as March 25, 2025.\n\n4. **Resolution Criteria**: The question resolves as YES if more than 90 executive orders are signed in February and March 2025. Given the pace of signing and the historical trend, it is plausible that Trump could reach or exceed this number.\n\n5. **Current Date and Question Closure**: The present date is March 26, 2025, and the question closed on March 10, 2025. This means the relevant period for signing executive orders was limited to February and early March.\n\nConsidering the high pace of executive orders being signed and the historical context of Trump's presidency, it is likely that he could have signed more than 90 executive orders in February and March 2025.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.8",

      "content": "Based on the following question, analyze it carefully and provide your probability estimate.\n\nQuestion: Will Donald Trump sign more than 90 executive orders in February and March 2025?\nBackground: According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order):\n\n> In the United States, an executive order is a directive by the president of the United States that manages operations of the federal government. The legal or constitutional basis for executive orders has multiple sources. Article Two of the United States Constitution gives presidents broad executive and enforcement authority to use their discretion to determine how to enforce the law or to otherwise manage the resources and staff of the executive branch. The ability to make such orders is also based on expressed or implied Acts of Congress that delegate to the president some degree of discretionary power (delegated legislation).\n\nThe number of Executive Orders that presidents issue in their first months in office has been rising significantly over the past years:\n\n| President      | Period  | Number of EOs |\n| -------------- | ------- | ------------- |\n| Bill Clinton   | Q1 1993 | 9             |\n| George W. Bush | Q1 2021 | 8             |\n| Barack Obama   | Q1 2009 | 18            |\n| Donald Trump   | Q1 2017 | 23            |\n| Joe Biden      | Q1 2021 | 37            |\n\nTrump surpassed all previous records in the first 8 days in office, [having signed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_executive_orders_in_the_second_presidency_of_Donald_Trump) 58 executive orders as of February 6, 2025.\nResolution criteria: This question will resolve as YES if Donald Trump signs more than 90 executive orders in February and March 2025, according to [the Federal Register](https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders).\n\n##### Note that this question closes early, on March 10, 2025.\nFine print: * An Executive Order is any presidential document with an Executive Order number. Orders that do not have such a number will not count for this question.\n* If the Federal Register delays in publishing an Executive Order, Metaculus might use alternative credible sources to resolve this question, such as [the Presidential Actions archive](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/).\n* This question will resolve according to the number of Executive Orders signed by Donald Trump in February and March, 2025. The date of publication is immaterial for this question.\npresent_date: 2025-03-26T12:28:22.768467\n\n\nMake sure to use the tools at your disposal to gather relevant information before providing your final probability estimate.\n\nYou may reason through the problem, but you MUST end your response with:\nFINAL PROBABILITY: [your decimal number between 0 and 1]"

      "content": "Based on the evidence gathered from multiple sources, here is the analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Executive Order Count**: As of February 6, 2025, Donald Trump had signed 58 executive orders. This is a significant number, indicating a high pace of executive order issuance.\n\n2. **Historical Context**: Trump has historically signed a large number of executive orders in his initial months in office, surpassing previous presidents. This trend seems to continue in 2025.\n\n3. **Recent Activity**: In March 2025, there has been a high frequency of executive orders being signed, with multiple orders signed on a single day, such as March 25, 2025.\n\n4. **Resolution Criteria**: The question resolves as YES if more than 90 executive orders are signed in February and March 2025. Given the pace of signing and the historical trend, it is plausible that Trump could reach or exceed this number.\n\n5. **Current Date and Question Closure**: The present date is March 26, 2025, and the question closed on March 10, 2025. This means the relevant period for signing executive orders was limited to February and early March.\n\nConsidering the high pace of executive orders being signed and the historical context of Trump's presidency, it is likely that he could have signed more than 90 executive orders in February and March 2025.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.8"
