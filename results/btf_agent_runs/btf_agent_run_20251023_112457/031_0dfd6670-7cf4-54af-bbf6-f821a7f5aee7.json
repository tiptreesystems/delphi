  "question": "Will the total market cap of the Magnificent Seven be greater than 18.5 trillion USD on March 28, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.4,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here's a summary of the current situation regarding the Magnificent Seven and the broader market:\n\n1. **Recent Performance**: The Magnificent Seven experienced significant growth in 2024, gaining 63% after a 75% rise the previous year. However, in early 2025, they have encountered challenges, with hedge funds reducing their holdings due to concerns about AI investments and diminishing returns.\n\n2. **Economic and Market Conditions**: The broader market has faced heightened economic uncertainty, partly due to trade policies such as tariffs announced by President Trump. These tariffs have led to significant market volatility, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite experiencing notable declines.\n\n3. **Forecasts and Expectations**: While the Magnificent Seven are expected to outperform the rest of the S&P 500 by 7 percentage points in 2025, this is the narrowest margin in seven years, indicating a potential slowdown in their dominance. Additionally, earnings growth for the Magnificent Seven in 2025 is expected to be lower than in 2024.\n\n4. **Sector Shifts**: There has been a shift in investor focus towards more defensive sectors like Health Care and Consumer Staples, moving away from the Magnificent Seven.\n\nGiven these factors, the Magnificent Seven's market cap is currently at $17.72 trillion. For it to exceed $18.5 trillion by March 28, 2025, it would require a significant positive shift in market sentiment or performance, which seems challenging given the current economic and market conditions.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.4",

There were bumps in the road—the group had its [worst day on record](https://www.investopedia.com/why-magnificent-seven-stocks-are-having-their-worst-day-on-record-8683011) in July—but, for the most part, the artificial intelligence (AI) boom continued to boost the stocks of these tech giants.\n\nSo, after two years of market dominance, what’s next for the [Magnificent Seven](https://www.investopedia.com/magnificent-seven-stocks-8402262)?\n\n## Will the Mag 7 Become Less Magnificent?\n\nCumulatively, the Magnificent Seven book more in profit in a single year than most countries’ entire stock markets. And even in America their profits put them head and shoulder above the rest.\n\nWithout the Mag Seven, aggregate S&P 500 earnings per share would have contracted in 2023 rather than grown. The group’s profits continued to lead the index in 2024, accounting for about 75% of S&P 500 earnings growth.\n\nIn 2025, however, growth is expected to broaden out as the…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 273 words out of ~821.

Hedge funds have been actively reducing their holdings in the group, reflecting concerns about the merits of substantial investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and angst about the associated \"law\" of diminishing returns. As a result, there has been a shift in investors' attention toward more defensive sectors like Health Care, while Financials' strength over the past few months has been undisturbed. We have market perform ratings on Health Care and Consumer Staples, and an outperform rating on Financials (more on sectors below).\n\n## Tariffs taxing confidence\n\nMacro concerns have also led to shifting market leadership trends, including an epic level of uncertainty with regard to Trump Administration policies, including tariffs and DOGE spending cuts.

An index number is a figure reflecting price or quantity compared with a base value. The base value always has an index number of 100. The index number is then expressed as 100 times the ratio to the base value. All corporate names and market data shown above are for illustrative purposes only and are not a recommendation, offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy any security. Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur management fees, costs and expenses and cannot be invested in directly. **Past performance is no guarantee of future results.**\n\nSeveral dynamics have contributed to this shift in performance dominance, not least being valuation and earnings concerns (more on that below). Hedge funds have been actively reducing their holdings in the group, reflecting concerns about the merits of substantial investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and angst about the associated \"law\" of diminishing returns. As a result, there has been a shift in investors' attention toward more defensive sectors like Health Care, while Financials' strength over the past few months has been undisturbed. We have market perform ratings on Health Care and Consumer Staples, and an outperform rating on Financials (more on sectors below).\n\n## Tariffs taxing confidence\n\nMacro concerns have also led to shifting market leadership trends, including an epic level of uncertainty with regard to Trump Administration policies, including tariffs and DOGE spending cuts. Specific to the former, (fourth-quarter earnings season wound down with Nvidia's earnings release last week) mentions of tariffs on company conference calls has gone parabolic—surpassing levels during the 2018 trade war.\n\nThe economic backdrop has deteriorated as well, with GDPNow from the Atlanta Federal Reserve having…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 366 words out of ~1451.

However, in early 2025, they have encountered challenges, with hedge funds reducing their holdings due to concerns about AI investments and diminishing returns.\n\n2. **Economic and Market Conditions**: The broader market has faced heightened economic uncertainty, partly due to trade policies such as tariffs announced by President Trump. These tariffs have led to significant market volatility, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite experiencing notable declines.\n\n3. **Forecasts and Expectations**: While the Magnificent Seven are expected to outperform the rest of the S&P 500 by 7 percentage points in 2025, this is the narrowest margin in seven years, indicating a potential slowdown in their dominance. Additionally, earnings growth for the Magnificent Seven in 2025 is expected to be lower than in 2024.\n\n4. **Sector Shifts**: There has been a shift in investor focus towards more defensive sectors like Health Care and Consumer Staples, moving away from the Magnificent Seven.\n\nGiven these factors, the Magnificent Seven's market cap is currently at $17.72 trillion. For it to exceed $18.5 trillion by March 28, 2025, it would require a significant positive shift in market sentiment or performance, which seems challenging given the current economic and market conditions.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.4"
