  "question": "Will the Great Lakes ice coverage be between 15.0% and 30.0% (inclusive) on March 30, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.75,
  "reasoning": "Based on the information gathered, here are some key facts:\n\n1. As of March 15, 2025, the Great Lakes Consolidated Ice Coverage is 15.63%. This is within the target range of 15.0% to 30.0% for the resolution of the question.\n2. Individual ice coverage for the lakes as of March 15, 2025, are:\n   - Lake Superior: 11.54%\n   - Lake Michigan: 11.83%\n   - Lake Huron: 21.79%\n   - Lake Erie: 28.00%\n   - Lake Ontario: 11.94%\n\nThe current ice coverage is just above the lower threshold of 15.0%. Given that the present date is March 23, 2025, and the ice coverage is already within the desired range, it is likely that the ice coverage will remain within this range until March 30, 2025, unless there are significant weather changes.\n\nConsidering historical trends and current conditions, the probability that the Great Lakes ice coverage will be between 15.0% and 30.0% on March 30, 2025, is relatively high.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.75",

For Lakes Michigan, Erie, and Ontario the shift occurred in the mid-1980s, but for Lakes Superior and Huron the shift occurred during the 1997/98 winter.\n23 - Ice cover has decreased the most in the north (i.e., Lake Superior, Northern Lake Michigan and Huron) and in coastal areas\n- Ice cover on the Great Lakes will likely continue to decrease in the future, however, these decreases are expected to be interrupted by high-ice winters associated with cold air outbreaks.\n- Reduced ice cover results in more winter lake-effect precipitation and increased winter wave activity.\n4\n\n**A more in-depth analysis of Great Lakes ice cover is available here from GLISA in our Sustained Assessment of the Lakes resource.**\n\n**Historical Trends**\n\nIce formation is influenced by the physical properties of the lakes (e.g., lake depth) and complex temperature-driven dynamics, which allows for large variability in ice conditions day-to-day, week-to-week, and year-to-year. Weekly variations in ice cover can be larger than the seasonal mean indicating large “swings” in ice conditions can occur on short time scales.[ 5](https://glisa.umich.edu#easy-footnote-bottom-5-918) These swings may be due to extreme weather events controlled by internal climate patterns such as Arctic Oscillation (AO) and ENSO.\n\n[On annual time scales, a winter with high ice cover can contribute to low ice cover the next year, and vice versa – a result of the complex relationship between ice cover, lake temperatures, and lake evaporation. This behavior speaks to the longer term “memory,” or heat capacity, of the lakes and how the effects of current conditions can carry over days, seasons, and years ahead.](https://glisa.umich.edu#easy-footnote-bottom-6-918)\n\n6The lakes have experienced less ice cover on average during the last 20-30 years compared to earlier years, prior to th…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 374 words out of ~1869.

For Lakes Michigan, Erie, and Ontario the shift occurred in the mid-1980s, but for Lakes Superior and Huron the shift occurred during the 1997/98 winter.\\n23 - Ice cover has decreased the most in the north (i.e., Lake Superior, Northern Lake Michigan and Huron) and in coastal areas\\n- Ice cover on the Great Lakes will likely continue to decrease in the future, however, these decreases are expected to be interrupted by high-ice winters associated with cold air outbreaks.\\n- Reduced ice cover results in more winter lake-effect precipitation and increased winter wave activity.\\n4\\n\\n**A more in-depth analysis of Great Lakes ice cover is available here from GLISA in our Sustained Assessment of the Lakes resource.**\\n\\n**Historical Trends**\\n\\nIce formation is influenced by the physical properties of the lakes (e.g., lake depth) and complex temperature-driven dynamics, which allows for large variability in ice conditions day-to-day, week-to-week, and year-to-year. Weekly variations in ice cover can be larger than the seasonal mean indicating large \\u201cswings\\u201d in ice conditions can occur on short time scales.[ 5](https://glisa.umich.edu#easy-footnote-bottom-5-918) These swings may be due to extreme weather events controlled by internal climate patterns such as Arctic Oscillation (AO) and ENSO.\\n\\n[On annual time scales, a winter with high ice cover can contribute to low ice cover the next year, and vice versa \\u2013 a result of the complex relationship between ice cover, lake temperatures, and lake evaporation. This behavior speaks to the longer term \\u201cmemory,\\u201d or heat capacity, of the lakes and how the effects of current conditions can carry over days, seasons, and years ahead.](https://glisa.umich.edu#easy-footnote-bottom-6-918)\\n\\n6The lakes have experienced less ice cover on average during the last 20-30 years compared to earlier years, prior to th\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 374 words out of ~1869.

      "content": "Based on the information gathered, here are some key facts:\n\n1. As of March 15, 2025, the Great Lakes Consolidated Ice Coverage is 15.63%. This is within the target range of 15.0% to 30.0% for the resolution of the question.\n2. Individual ice coverage for the lakes as of March 15, 2025, are:\n   - Lake Superior: 11.54%\n   - Lake Michigan: 11.83%\n   - Lake Huron: 21.79%\n   - Lake Erie: 28.00%\n   - Lake Ontario: 11.94%\n\nThe current ice coverage is just above the lower threshold of 15.0%. Given that the present date is March 23, 2025, and the ice coverage is already within the desired range, it is likely that the ice coverage will remain within this range until March 30, 2025, unless there are significant weather changes.\n\nConsidering historical trends and current conditions, the probability that the Great Lakes ice coverage will be between 15.0% and 30.0% on March 30, 2025, is relatively high.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.75"
