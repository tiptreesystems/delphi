  "question": "Will S&P 500 recover half its drop by April 7, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.45,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here are the key points affecting the probability of the S&P 500 recovering half its drop by April 7, 2025:\n\n1. **Market Performance and Volatility**:\n   - The S&P 500 fell 1.3% in February 2025, indicating recent downward pressure on the index.\n   - Market volatility has increased due to President Trump's new tariff announcements, which could continue to impact investor sentiment and market performance.\n\n2. **Economic Indicators**:\n   - The PE ratio on the S&P 500 is high, requiring a constant stream of good news to maintain current levels.\n   - Recent data on housing and consumer confidence suggest a downshift in economic growth, which could affect market recovery.\n   - Modest GDP growth is expected, just above 2.0% for 2025, despite market volatility.\n\n3. **Market Trends**:\n   - As of early March 2025, the S&P 500 is sitting right at the 200-day moving average, a critical indicator of market trends.\n   - The US Dollar Index started to weaken at the start of March, which is seen as a potential positive for the stock market in the short term.\n   - Inflation expectations have jumped to 4.3%, which could impact consumer sentiment and market performance.\n\n4. **Investor Sentiment**:\n   - The bond market has rallied due to economic concerns, not because of positive inflation trends, indicating investor caution.\n   - Productivity gains from AI adoption are expected to be gradual but substantive, potentially supporting earnings in a slower-growth environment.\n\nConsidering these factors, the market is facing significant uncertainty with mixed economic signals. The high PE ratio and inflation concerns could weigh on the market, while the weakening dollar and potential productivity gains might provide some support. Given the current market conditions and the need for the S&P 500 to close at $5,832.84 or higher by April 7, 2025, the probability of recovery seems moderate.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.45",

Check through the report for all the latest trends in the financial world.\nsitename: AdvicePeriod\ndate: 2025-03-07\ncategories: ['Market Commentary', 'Monthly Market Commentary']\ntags: ['financial market commentary']\n---\nPlease find our most recent market review below. We hope these perspectives are valuable to you.\n\n– The AdvicePeriod Team\n\n**Key Observations**\n\n*Major indices declined with the Nasdaq dropping 3.9%, the S&P 500 falling 1.3% and the Dow Jones down 1.4%.**A significant market rotation occurred away from technology stocks toward healthcare, consumer staples and financials, partly triggered by competitive pressures in the AI sector.**Market volatility spiked due to President Donald Trump’s new tariff announcements, Federal Reserve policy uncertainty and concerns about Nvidia’s future profit margins despite strong revenue growth.*\n\nThe month of February 2025 proved to be a turbulent period for financial markets, with significant movements across major indices and sectors. This newsletter examines the key developments that shaped market performance and offers perspective on navigating the current investment landscape.\n\n## Market Recap\n\n## Major Indices Post February Declines\n\nFebruary 2025 concluded with losses across all major U.S. stock indices, despite a rally on the final trading day of the month. The Nasdaq Composite experienced the most severe decline, falling approximately 3.9%. The S&P 500 dropped about 1.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.4%.\n\nThis downturn is particularly notable given that just weeks earlier, the S&P 500 had reached all-time highs, with the Dow and Nasdaq similarly approaching record levels. The sudden reversal highlights how quickly market sentiment can shift. The final trading day of February saw a modest recovery, with stocks rising after the release of benign inflation data that showed price pressures easing in January.\n\nThe month’s volatility stands in stark contrast to January’s positive performance, when both the Dow and S&P 500 posted gains following December’s losses. This pattern of alternating monthly performance underscores the importance of maintaining a long-term perspective rather than reacting to short-term fluctuations.\n\nInvestors should…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 347 words out of ~2072.

One prominent example is that investors have been jolted by a wake-up call to be more attentive to broad economic data.\n\nWhen high valuations collide with uncertainty, the volatility ushers in an environment where various potential risks will be scrutinized. Stubborn inflation, Fed policy gridlock, possible consumer vulnerability, tariffs, uncertainty attached to policy announcements, and the perennial debt ceiling vote are all being evaluated against the very high standards that accompany elevated valuations.\n\nFurther, markets may become increasingly nervous if this year’s much-hyped M&A surge fails to materialize. Thus far, it is off to a slow start, with data from late February running behind last year’s numbers. The M&A trend could take a while to get underway, though a choppy market won’t help accelerate the process.\n\nThe economic outlook was reasonably encouraging after a solid earnings season. However, recent data on housing and consumer confidence and commentary from prominent consumer-facing companies suggest a downshift in economic growth.\n\nModest payroll gains will continue to support GDP growth throughout 2025 at a level just above 2.0% despite market unsteadiness and recent data. Figure 2 shows the slowing but steady trend in job gains.\n\nWith current valuations among the highest 15% recorded over the past 30 years, any whiff of weakness has the potential to ripple across broad bands of the stock market.\n\n## Bonds\n\nThe bond rally over the past two weeks, which brought yields from 4.65 to 4.31 (Figure 3), appears to have happened for the “wrong” reason. In effect, bonds rallied out of economic concern rather than because inflation seems to be heading in the right direction.\n\nThe economic data indicates a downshift rather than a recession. Over time, interest rates will gradually…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 380 words out of ~1068. Full content available via `btf_extract_evidence`.]"

Large Cap outperformed the Small and Mid-Cap indexes, with both turning negative for the year. Global indexes faired better, with the MSCI EAFE and MSCI Emerging Markets indexes showing modest monthly returns. After a strong January, bonds continued higher as the CRB Commodity Index dropped a bit more than 1% in February.\n\nAll data as of 03/03/2025, Source: Wells Fargo Investment Institute. **An index is not managed and not available for direct investment. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results.** [Wells Fargo Investment Institute, Inc. is a registered investment advisor and wholly-owned subsidiary of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., a bank affiliate of Wells Fargo & Company.]\n\nOur [February Commentary ](https://magellanlv.com/blog/market-reports/stock-market-commentary-february-2025/)was primarily focused on a possible trade war and how to invest in an unsure market environment. We argued that the threatened 25% across-the-board tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods was not the likely scenario, it was a possibility to be prepared for. We are at the start of what is likely a period of economic policy changes from the Federal Government. Since the end of 2024 we have staunchly believed that investors need to be prepared for a variety of policy moves.\n\nWe want to reiterate our belief that the stock market remains in a secular bull market(1) and investors need to get comfortable with uncertainty. Now may be a good time to review your holdings and asset allocation. However, in our opinion, the goal of such a review should be to make sure your investments are aligned with your long-term planning, not make a big “bet” on the direction of the market in the coming weeks or months. Put another way, we believe that spec…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 386 words out of ~2751. Full content available via `btf_extract_evidence`.]"

The Nasdaq Composite experienced the most severe decline, falling approximately 3.9%. The S&P 500 dropped about 1.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.4%.\n\nThis downturn is particularly notable given that just weeks earlier, the S&P 500 had reached all-time highs, with the Dow and Nasdaq similarly approaching record levels.

The final trading day of February saw a modest recovery, with stocks rising after the release of benign inflation data that showed price pressures easing in January.\n\nThe month’s volatility stands in stark contrast to January’s positive performance, when both the Dow and S&P 500 posted gains following December’s losses.

We hope these perspectives are valuable to you.\\n\\n\\u2013 The AdvicePeriod Team\\n\\n**Key Observations**\\n\\n*Major indices declined with the Nasdaq dropping 3.9%, the S&P 500 falling 1.3% and the Dow Jones down 1.4%.**A significant market rotation occurred away from technology stocks toward healthcare, consumer staples and financials, partly triggered by competitive pressures in the AI sector.**Market volatility spiked due to President Donald Trump\\u2019s new tariff announcements, Federal Reserve policy uncertainty and concerns about Nvidia\\u2019s future profit margins despite strong revenue growth.*\\n\\nThe month of February 2025 proved to be a turbulent period for financial markets, with significant movements across major indices and sectors. This newsletter examines the key developments that shaped market performance and offers perspective on navigating the current investment landscape.\\n\\n## Market Recap\\n\\n## Major Indices Post February Declines\\n\\nFebruary 2025 concluded with losses across all major U.S. stock indices, despite a rally on the final trading day of the month. The Nasdaq Composite experienced the most severe decline, falling approximately 3.9%. The S&P 500 dropped about 1.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.4%.\\n\\nThis downturn is particularly notable given that just weeks earlier, the S&P 500 had reached all-time highs, with the Dow and Nasdaq similarly approaching record levels. The sudden reversal highlights how quickly market sentiment can shift. The final trading day of February saw a modest recovery, with stocks rising after the release of benign inflation data that showed price pressures easing in January.\\n\\nThe month\\u2019s volatility stands in stark contrast to January\\u2019s positive performance, when both the Dow and S&P 500 posted gains following December\\u2019s losses. This pattern of alternating monthly performance underscores the importance of maintaining a long-term perspective rather than reacting to short-term fluctuations.\\n\\nInvestors should\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 347 words out of ~2072.

One prominent example is that investors have been jolted by a wake-up call to be more attentive to broad economic data.\\n\\nWhen high valuations collide with uncertainty, the volatility ushers in an environment where various potential risks will be scrutinized. Stubborn inflation, Fed policy gridlock, possible consumer vulnerability, tariffs, uncertainty attached to policy announcements, and the perennial debt ceiling vote are all being evaluated against the very high standards that accompany elevated valuations.\\n\\nFurther, markets may become increasingly nervous if this year\\u2019s much-hyped M&A surge fails to materialize. Thus far, it is off to a slow start, with data from late February running behind last year\\u2019s numbers. The M&A trend could take a while to get underway, though a choppy market won\\u2019t help accelerate the process.\\n\\nThe economic outlook was reasonably encouraging after a solid earnings season. However, recent data on housing and consumer confidence and commentary from prominent consumer-facing companies suggest a downshift in economic growth.\\n\\nModest payroll gains will continue to support GDP growth throughout 2025 at a level just above 2.0% despite market unsteadiness and recent data. Figure 2 shows the slowing but steady trend in job gains.\\n\\nWith current valuations among the highest 15% recorded over the past 30 years, any whiff of weakness has the potential to ripple across broad bands of the stock market.\\n\\n## Bonds\\n\\nThe bond rally over the past two weeks, which brought yields from 4.65 to 4.31 (Figure 3), appears to have happened for the \\u201cwrong\\u201d reason. In effect, bonds rallied out of economic concern rather than because inflation seems to be heading in the right direction.\\n\\nThe economic data indicates a downshift rather than a recession. Over time, interest rates will gradually\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 380 words out of ~1068.

Large Cap outperformed the Small and Mid-Cap indexes, with both turning negative for the year.

We argued that the threatened 25% across-the-board tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods was not the likely scenario, it was a possibility to be prepared for. We are at the start of what is likely a period of economic policy changes from the Federal Government. Since the end of 2024 we have staunchly believed that investors need to be prepared for a variety of policy moves.\\n\\nWe want to reiterate our belief that the stock market remains in a secular bull market(1) and investors need to get comfortable with uncertainty. Now may be a good time to review your holdings and asset allocation. However, in our opinion, the goal of such a review should be to make sure your investments are aligned with your long-term planning, not make a big \\u201cbet\\u201d on the direction of the market in the coming weeks or months.
