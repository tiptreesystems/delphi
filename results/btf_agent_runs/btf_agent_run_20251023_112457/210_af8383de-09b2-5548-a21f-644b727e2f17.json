  "probability": 0.0,
  "reasoning": "Based on the information gathered, the Just Security litigation tracker currently lists 132 cases against the Trump Administration as of March 20, 2025. This number is significantly higher than the range of 36 to 40 lawsuits specified in the question for a \"YES\" resolution. \n\nGiven the current number of lawsuits and the fact that the tracker is continually updated, it is highly unlikely that the number of lawsuits will decrease to fall within the specified range by March 31, 2025.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.0",
