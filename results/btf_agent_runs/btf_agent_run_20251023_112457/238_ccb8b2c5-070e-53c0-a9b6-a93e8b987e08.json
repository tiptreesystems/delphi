  "question": "Will NOAA's Climate.gov still be online on April 1, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.95,
  "reasoning": "Based on the search results for the queries related to the status of Climate.gov in March 2025, government policy changes affecting NOAA, and any technical issues with Climate.gov, here are the findings:\n\n1. **Climate.gov Status**: The search results do not indicate any specific issues or downtime for Climate.gov in March 2025. The website appears to be operational, with recent updates and content being published, such as climate outlooks and ENSO updates.\n\n2. **Government Policy Changes**: There is a mention of \"Project 2025\" which proposes changes to NOAA, including breaking up the organization and focusing on commercial operations. However, there is no direct indication that these proposals have been implemented or that they affect the current status of Climate.gov.\n\n3. **Technical Issues**: No specific technical issues for Climate.gov in March 2025 were found in the search results. The website seems to be functioning normally with no reported outages or problems.\n\nGiven that Climate.gov is currently operational and there are no immediate threats or issues reported that would suggest it will go offline by April 1, 2025, the probability that Climate.gov will still be online on that date is high.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.95",

The website appears to be operational, with recent updates and content being published, such as climate outlooks and ENSO updates.\n\n2. **Government Policy Changes**: There is a mention of \"Project 2025\" which proposes changes to NOAA, including breaking up the organization and focusing on commercial operations. However, there is no direct indication that these proposals have been implemented or that they affect the current status of Climate.gov.\n\n3. **Technical Issues**: No specific technical issues for Climate.gov in March 2025 were found in the search results. The website seems to be functioning normally with no reported outages or problems.\n\nGiven that Climate.gov is currently operational and there are no immediate threats or issues reported that would suggest it will go offline by April 1, 2025, the probability that Climate.gov will still be online on that date is high.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.95"
