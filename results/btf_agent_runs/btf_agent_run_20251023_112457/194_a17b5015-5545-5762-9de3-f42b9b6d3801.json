  "question": "Will Jeff Bezos be ranked 2nd on the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List on March 29, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.3,
  "reasoning": "Based on the information gathered:\n\n1. As of March 12, 2025, Jeff Bezos is ranked 3rd on the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List with a net worth of $215 billion. Mark Zuckerberg is ranked 2nd, also with a net worth of $215 billion. This indicates that their rankings are very close and could change with slight fluctuations in their net worths.\n\n2. Jeff Bezos's net worth as of March 2025 is $217 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which suggests there might be slight discrepancies between different sources, but generally, he is not currently ranked 2nd.\n\n3. The rankings are subject to change due to fluctuations in stock prices and business performances, which can affect the net worth of these billionaires.\n\nGiven that Jeff Bezos is currently ranked 3rd and not 2nd, and considering the close competition with Mark Zuckerberg, there is a possibility of a change in rankings by March 29, 2025. However, the current data suggests that he is not in the 2nd position.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.3",

Under his leadership, Amazon revolutionized the retail industry, pioneering innovations like one-click ordering, Amazon Prime, and cloud computing services through Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nBezos is also known for his ventures outside of Amazon. In 2000, he founded Blue Origin, a private aerospace company focused on space exploration. In 2013, he purchased The Washington Post, revitalizing the newspaper with a focus on digital growth.\n\nWith a net worth consistently among [the highest in the world](https://americanbazaaronline.com/2024/11/22/top-ten-richest-billionaires-in-the-world-87654/), Bezos has become a symbol of modern entrepreneurship, technology, and innovation.

The global billionaire population continued to grow in 2025, increasing by 7%. [Beinsure Media](https://beinsure.com/) has collected the data and presents a ranking of the world’s richest people as March 2025.\n\n[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/)Billionaires Index\n\nThe individuals on this list belong to an even more exclusive club and wield still more power. Many are founders of technology giants, with much of their wealth still invested in the companies they started.\n\nBillionaires play an outsized role in shaping the [global economy](https://beinsure.com/global-economy-outlook-2075/), politics, and philanthropy. Details about the calculations are provided in the net worth analysis on each billionaire’s profile page.\n\nMost people have a pretty good idea, even if they’re not an entrepreneur or interested in the subject at all, for that matter.\n\n\nThese billionaires can, however, still borrow against that wealth to avoid selling stock, deferring (or eliminating for heirs) taxes on unrealized capital gains in the process. Multi-billionaires can also take advantage of a panoply of tax deductions to offset reported income, leaving some on this list paying no income tax in recent years.\n\n### 10 Richest People in the World in 2025\n\n**TOP 50 World’s Richest People 2025**\n\n№ | NAME | WORTH | SOURCE |\n| 1 | Elon Musk 🤡 | $334B | Tesla, SpaceX |\n| 2 | Mark Zuckerberg | $215B | |\n| 3 | Jeff Bezos | $215B | Amazon |\n| 4 | Larry Ellison | $187B | Oracle |\n| 5 | Bernard Arnault | $173B | LVMH |\n| 6 | Warren Buffett | $155B | Berkshire Hathaway |\n| 7 | Larry Page | $139B | |\n| 8 | Sergey Brin | $133B | |\n| 9 | Steve Ballmer | $116B | Microsoft |\n| 10 | Amancio Ortega | $114B | Zara |\n| 11 | Bill Gates | $107B | Microsoft |\n| 12 | Michael Bloomberg | $105B | Bloomberg LP |\n| 13 | Rob Walton | $104B | Walmart |\n| 14 | Jim Walton | $103B | Walmart |\n| 15 | Jensen Huang | $101B | Nvidia |\n| 16 | Michael…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 429 words out of ~10924.

      "content": "Based on the information gathered:\n\n1. As of March 12, 2025, Jeff Bezos is ranked 3rd on the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List with a net worth of $215 billion. Mark Zuckerberg is ranked 2nd, also with a net worth of $215 billion. This indicates that their rankings are very close and could change with slight fluctuations in their net worths.\n\n2. Jeff Bezos's net worth as of March 2025 is $217 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which suggests there might be slight discrepancies between different sources, but generally, he is not currently ranked 2nd.\n\n3. The rankings are subject to change due to fluctuations in stock prices and business performances, which can affect the net worth of these billionaires.\n\nGiven that Jeff Bezos is currently ranked 3rd and not 2nd, and considering the close competition with Mark Zuckerberg, there is a possibility of a change in rankings by March 29, 2025. However, the current data suggests that he is not in the 2nd position.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.3"
