  "question": "Will there be a new world record in the 2025 World Figure Skating Championships?",
  "probability": 0.65,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered information, here are some key points that influence the probability of a new world record being set at the 2025 World Figure Skating Championships:\n\n1. **High-Level Competition**: The 2025 World Figure Skating Championships will feature 200 athletes from 50 countries, showcasing top talent in men's singles, women's singles, pairs, and ice dance. The presence of top skaters like Ilia Malinin, Kaori Sakamoto, and Amber Glenn, who have been performing at high levels, increases the likelihood of record-breaking performances.\n\n2. **Recent Performances**: Ilia Malinin is noted for his ongoing growth and technical prowess, which could lead to high scores. Amber Glenn, known for her triple axel, has recently bested Kaori Sakamoto at the Grand Prix Final, indicating strong competitive form.\n\n3. **Historical Context**: The event will be held in Boston, a familiar location for some athletes, which might provide a psychological advantage. The last time Boston hosted the World Championships was in 2016.\n\n4. **Anticipation and Preparation**: The championships are highly anticipated, with recent competitions like the ISU Four Continents Championships and the Grand Prix Final providing benchmarks for the athletes' current form.\n\n5. **Potential for Records**: The presence of skaters who are capable of executing high-difficulty elements, such as the triple axel and quadruple jumps, increases the potential for setting new records in TES, PCS, or TSS.\n\nGiven these factors, the probability of a new world record being set at the 2025 World Figure Skating Championships is reasonably high.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.65",

We are pleased to bring you \"Predictions 2025,\" a special New Year's series sharing the foresight and expectations of selected contributors for the coming year in their fields of specialty, continuing with Jack Gallagher's forecast for figure skating.*\n\n**Next in the Series**\n\nDespite enjoying another banner year on the ice in 2024, there will be plenty of challenges in 2025 for Japanese skaters. Their nine medals at the combined Junior and Senior Grand Prix Final in December in Grenoble, France, [represented an all-time best for Japan](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/ice-time-grand-prix-final-bonanza-mao-shimada-leads-way-as-japan-gets-new-medal-mark/) at the prestigious event. However, only one of those medals was gold ー junior [Mao Shimada](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/mao-shimada/)'s.\n\nThe retirement of two-time world champion [Shoma Uno](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/shoma-uno/) after last season and the continued emergence of two American skaters ([Ilia Malinin](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/ilia-malinin/) and [Amber Glenn](https://www.isuresults.com/bios/isufs00034367.htm)) this campaign could well impact the success the Hinomaru enjoys at the world level this year.\n\nUno's retirement was not unexpected, but the ongoing growth of Malinin will make it difficult for a Japanese man to ascend to the top of skating in 2025. Beijing Olympic silver medalist [Yuma Kagiyama](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/yuma-kagiyama/) is the primary challenger to Malinin. But the 21-year-old Kagiyama will be the first to admit that the gap in their recent results has not been close.\n\n[Shun Sato](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/shun-sato/), [Kao Miura](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/kao-miura/) and [Tatsuya Tsuboi](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/tatsuya-tsuboi/) will be vying to join Kagiyama on the 2026 Olympic team during the 2025 season. Their maturation over the next 12 months will be a key to whether the Japan men can win multiple medals at the 2025 World Figure Skating Championships in Boston.\n\nSato, Miura and Tsuboi are all capable of pulling off great skates, but lack the consistency and stability of Kagiyama.\n\n## Predictions for Sakamoto and Chiba\n\n[Kaori Sakamoto](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/kaori-sakamoto/) won her third consecutive world crown in 2024 but was unable to retain her title at the GP Final after being bested by the resurgent Glenn, who is riding her triple axel to new heights.\n\nThe 24-year-old Sakamoto claimed [her fourth consecutive title](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/kaori-sakamoto-rolls-to-4th-straight-title-at-the-japan-championships/) at the Japan Championships, which had to give her a boost going into 2025. Without the triple axel that Glenn possesses, however, a fourth straight world crown may be a tough hill to climb for the Kobe native.\n\n[Mone Chiba](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/mone-chiba/)'s emergence continued with a silver medal behind Glenn at the GP Final. However, she has now been in position to have a great result a few times the past few seasons, but seems to find a way not to. The 19-year-old Chiba's issue is not her skating, but rather her confidence to perform in the clutch.\n\nChiba who [won the Four Continents Championships](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/mone-chiba-wins-gold-at-four-continents-rinka-watanabe-claims-bronze/) in 2024, clearly has the skating skills to be a world medalist. The real question is whether she has the fortitude to do it. We will find out in March.\n\n## Matsuike and Higuchi Plagued by Inconsistency\n\n[Rino Matsuike](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/rino-matsuike/) and [Wakaba Higuchi](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/wakaba-higuchi/) have excelled at times during the 2024-25 season, but can't be relied on for consistent results. After medaling at both of her GP events in 2024, [Hana Yoshida](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/hana-yoshida/)'s fifth-place finish at the GP Final and coming in 11th at the Japan Championships represents cause for concern.\n\nWith two-time world junior champion Shimada not eligible to compete at the 2026 Olympics due to her age, the battle for the berths for Milan among the senior Japanese women will be intense. Sakamoto looks like the only lock at this point.\n\n[Rika Kihira](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/rika-kihira/) retains hopes of a comeback in 2025. But after missing most of the past four seasons due to injury, it is hard to envision a realistic path back for the two-time Japan champion. So much time has gone by that even at 22 it looks like Kihira's time may have sadly passed.\n\n## Predictions: Expect a Banner Year for Japan's Juniors\n\nThe outlook for both Japan's junior women and men is bright for the new year.\n\nShimada will be going for an unprecedented third straight world junior title in 2025 and will be a favorite to achieve the feat despite her struggles this season with her triple axel and quadruple toe loop. She [repeated as JGP Final champion in 2024](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/mao-shimada-wins-junior-grand-prix-final-for-3rd-consecutive-year/) and [claimed her fourth straight Japan junior title](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/mao-shimada-wins-a-record-4th-straight-title-at-the-japan-junior-championships/). And Shimada continued her impressive win streak in which she has never lost a competition she entered as a junior.\n\nFifteen-year-old [Kaoruko Wada](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/kaoruko-wada/) was a pleasant revelation in her international debut season with two medals during the JGP events and a silver behind Shimada at the JGP Final. [Ami Nakai](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/ami-nakai/) also netted two JGP medals and a bronze at the JGP Final in Japan's sweep.\n\nThough [Rio Nakata](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/rio-nakata/), now 16, could not defend his JGP Final title, he impressed by coming in second behind Kagiyama at December's Japan Championships. Nakata will also not be age-eligible to compete in the 2026 Olympics but appears poised for continued success on the junior circuit.\n\n[Sena Takahashi](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/sena-takahashi/), who will turn 15 on January 29, enjoyed a fine international debut campaign. He medaled at both of his JGPs, was second at the Japan Junior Championships, and took fourth at the JGP Final. Fans can expect more solid results from him in 2025.\n\n## Miura and Kihara Eyeing a 2nd World Title\n\nPairs [Riku Miura](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/riku-miura/) and [Ryuichi Kihara](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/ryuichi-kihara/), world champions in 2023, will look to climb back to the top of the world podium in March. After winning their opening GP this season, they were second at both the NHK Trophy and the GP Final.\n\nMiura and Kihara appeared to be struggling to regain their top form after he was injured last season and they got off to a late start, though they still earned the silver medal at the 2024 world championships.\n\n## RELATED:\n\n*Read other predictions from our series,**Predictions 2025**Follow Ice Time and other figure skating news**on SportsLook**.**Predictions 2024: Japan's Figure Skaters Set to Continue Run of Success*\n\n\nAuthor: [Jack Gallagher](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/jack-gallagher/)\n\n*The author is a veteran sports journalist and one of the world's foremost figure skating experts.

We are pleased to bring you \"Predictions 2025,\" a special New Year's series sharing the foresight and expectations of selected contributors for the coming year in their fields of specialty, continuing with Jack Gallagher's forecast for figure skating.*\n\n**Next in the Series**\n\nDespite enjoying another banner year on the ice in 2024, there will be plenty of challenges in 2025 for Japanese skaters. Their nine medals at the combined Junior and Senior Grand Prix Final in December in Grenoble, France, [represented an all-time best for Japan](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/ice-time-grand-prix-final-bonanza-mao-shimada-leads-way-as-japan-gets-new-medal-mark/) at the prestigious event. However, only one of those medals was gold ー junior [Mao Shimada](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/mao-shimada/)'s.\n\nThe retirement of two-time world champion [Shoma Uno](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/shoma-uno/) after last season and the continued emergence of two American skaters ([Ilia Malinin](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/ilia-malinin/) and [Amber Glenn](https://www.isuresults.com/bios/isufs00034367.htm)) this campaign could well impact the success the Hinomaru enjoys at the world level this year.\n\nUno's retirement was not unexpected, but the ongoing growth of Malinin will make it difficult for a Japanese man to ascend to the top of skating in 2025. Beijing Olympic silver medalist [Yuma Kagiyama](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/yuma-kagiyama/) is the primary challenger to Malinin. But the 21-year-old Kagiyama will be the first to admit that the gap in their recent results has not been close.\n\n[Shun Sato](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/shun-sato/), [Kao Miura](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/kao-miura/) and [Tatsuya Tsuboi](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/tatsuya-tsuboi/) will be vying to join Kagiyama on the 2026 Olympic team during the 2025 season. Their maturation over the next 12 months will be a key to whether the Japan men can win multiple medals at the 2025 World Figure Skating Championships in Boston.\n\nSato, Miura and Tsuboi are all capable of pulling off great skates, but lack the consistency and stability of Kagiyama.\n\n## Predictions for Sakamoto and Chiba\n\n[Kaori Sakamoto](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/kaori-sakamoto/) won her third consecutive world crown in 2024 but was unable to retain her title at the GP Final after being bested by the resurgent Glenn, who is riding her triple axel to new heights.\n\nThe 24-year-old Sakamoto claimed [her fourth consecutive title](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/kaori-sakamoto-rolls-to-4th-straight-title-at-the-japan-championships/) at the Japan Championships, which had to give her a boost going into 2025. Without the triple axel that Glenn possesses, however, a fourth straight world crown may be a tough hill to climb for the Kobe native.\n\n[Mone Chiba](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/mone-chiba/)'s emergence continued with a silver medal behind Glenn at the GP Final. However, she has now been in position to have a great result a few times the past few seasons, but seems to find a way not to. The 19-year-old Chiba's issue is not her skating, but rather her confidence to perform in the clutch.\n\nChiba who [won the Four Continents Championships](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/mone-chiba-wins-gold-at-four-continents-rinka-watanabe-claims-bronze/) in 2024, clearly has the skating skills to be a world medalist. The real question is whether she has the fortitude to do it. We will find out in March.\n\n## Matsuike and Higuchi Plagued by Inconsistency\n\n[Rino Matsuike](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/rino-matsuike/) and [Wakaba Higuchi](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/wakaba-higuchi/) have excelled at times during the 2024-25 season, but can't be relied on for consistent results. After medaling at both of her GP events in 2024, [Hana Yoshida](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/hana-yoshida/)'s fifth-place finish at the GP Final and coming in 11th at the Japan Championships represents cause for concern.\n\nWith two-time world junior champion Shimada not eligible to compete at the 2026 Olympics due to her age, the battle for the berths for Milan among the senior Japanese women will be intense. Sakamoto looks like the only lock at this point.\n\n[Rika Kihira](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/rika-kihira/) retains hopes of a comeback in 2025. But after missing most of the past four seasons due to injury, it is hard to envision a realistic path back for the two-time Japan champion. So much time has gone by that even at 22 it looks like Kihira's time may have sadly passed.\n\n## Predictions: Expect a Banner Year for Japan's Juniors\n\nThe outlook for both Japan's junior women and men is bright for the new year.\n\nShimada will be going for an unprecedented third straight world junior title in 2025 and will be a favorite to achieve the feat despite her struggles this season with her triple axel and quadruple toe loop. She [repeated as JGP Final champion in 2024](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/mao-shimada-wins-junior-grand-prix-final-for-3rd-consecutive-year/) and [claimed her fourth straight Japan junior title](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/mao-shimada-wins-a-record-4th-straight-title-at-the-japan-junior-championships/). And Shimada continued her impressive win streak in which she has never lost a competition she entered as a junior.\n\nFifteen-year-old [Kaoruko Wada](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/kaoruko-wada/) was a pleasant revelation in her international debut season with two medals during the JGP events and a silver behind Shimada at the JGP Final. [Ami Nakai](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/ami-nakai/) also netted two JGP medals and a bronze at the JGP Final in Japan's sweep.\n\nThough [Rio Nakata](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/rio-nakata/), now 16, could not defend his JGP Final title, he impressed by coming in second behind Kagiyama at December's Japan Championships. Nakata will also not be age-eligible to compete in the 2026 Olympics but appears poised for continued success on the junior circuit.\n\n[Sena Takahashi](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/sena-takahashi/), who will turn 15 on January 29, enjoyed a fine international debut campaign. He medaled at both of his JGPs, was second at the Japan Junior Championships, and took fourth at the JGP Final. Fans can expect more solid results from him in 2025.\n\n## Miura and Kihara Eyeing a 2nd World Title\n\nPairs [Riku Miura](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/riku-miura/) and [Ryuichi Kihara](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/ryuichi-kihara/), world champions in 2023, will look to climb back to the top of the world podium in March. After winning their opening GP this season, they were second at both the NHK Trophy and the GP Final.\n\nMiura and Kihara appeared to be struggling to regain their top form after he was injured last season and they got off to a late start, though they still earned the silver medal at the 2024 world championships.\n\n## RELATED:\n\n*Read other predictions from our series,**Predictions 2025**Follow Ice Time and other figure skating news**on SportsLook**.**Predictions 2024: Japan's Figure Skaters Set to Continue Run of Success*\n\n\nAuthor: [Jack Gallagher](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/jack-gallagher/)\n\n*The author is a veteran sports journalist and one of the world's foremost figure skating experts.

[Ami Nakai](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/ami-nakai/) also netted two JGP medals and a bronze at the JGP Final in Japan's sweep.\\n\\nThough [Rio Nakata](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/rio-nakata/), now 16, could not defend his JGP Final title, he impressed by coming in second behind Kagiyama at December's Japan Championships. Nakata will also not be age-eligible to compete in the 2026 Olympics but appears poised for continued success on the junior circuit.\\n\\n[Sena Takahashi](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/sena-takahashi/), who will turn 15 on January 29, enjoyed a fine international debut campaign. He medaled at both of his JGPs, was second at the Japan Junior Championships, and took fourth at the JGP Final. Fans can expect more solid results from him in 2025.\\n\\n## Miura and Kihara Eyeing a 2nd World Title\\n\\nPairs [Riku Miura](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/riku-miura/) and [Ryuichi Kihara](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/ryuichi-kihara/), world champions in 2023, will look to climb back to the top of the world podium in March. After winning their opening GP this season, they were second at both the NHK Trophy and the GP Final.\\n\\nMiura and Kihara appeared to be struggling to regain their top form after he was injured last season and they got off to a late start, though they still earned the silver medal at the 2024 world championships.\\n\\n## RELATED:\\n\\n*Read other predictions from our series,**Predictions 2025**Follow Ice Time and other figure skating news**on SportsLook**.**Predictions 2024: Japan's Figure Skaters Set to Continue Run of Success*\\n\\n\\nAuthor: [Jack Gallagher](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/jack-gallagher/)\\n\\n*The author is a veteran sports journalist and one of the world's foremost figure skating experts.

The [World Figure Skating Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_World_Figure_Skating_Championships), organised annually by the [International Skating Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Skating_Union) (ISU) since 1896, represents the most prestigious annual competition in the sport outside the Olympic Games. The [2025 World Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_World_Figure_Skating_Championships) are scheduled to take place in Boston, from March 25 to March 30.\n\nIn all official competitions, athletes are scored using the [ISU Judging System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISU_Judging_System), which consists of two components: the Technical Score (TES) and the Program Components Score (PCS).

The Program Components Score evaluates five aspects of the performance: skating skills, transitions, performance, composition, and interpretation of music, with judges awarding points on a scale of 0.25 to 10.00 in each category.\n\nThe TES and PCS are added together to form the Total Segment Score (TSS), which is calculated for both short programs and free skating and added together to determine an athlete's final ranking.\nResolution criteria: This question will resolve as **Yes** if in the 2025 World Figure Skating Championships, there is a new world record in any category (men's singles, women's singles, pairs, ice dance), for any segment, on any of the possible scores:\n\n* TES – Technical element score\n* PCS – Program component score\n* TSS – Total segment score\n* Combine Total TSS across segments.\nFine print: * If at least half of the 2025 World Figure Skating Championships events do not take place before April 7, 2025, this question will be **annulled**.\n* In case a performance setting a new record is announced, but has not been officially verified (in case of potential disputes), it will count for the purposes of this question if it has not been cancelled as of April 7, 2025.\n* The [current world records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest_scores_in_figure_skating) are presented below:\n\n| Category        | Segment        | Score type | Score  |\n| --------------- | -------------- | ---------- | ------ |\n| Men's singles   | Combined total | TSS        | 335.30 |\n| Men's singles   | Short program  | TSS        | 113.97 |\n| Men's singles   | Short program  | TES        | 65.98  |\n| Men's singles   | Short program  | PCS        | 48.47  |\n| Men's singles   | Free skating   | TSS        | 227.79 |\n| Men's singles   | Free skating   | TES        | 137.18 |\n| Men's singles   | Free skating   | PCS        | 97.22  |\n| Women's singles | Combined total | TSS        | 272.71 |\n| Women's singles | Short program  | TSS        | 87.52  |\n| Women's singles | Short program  | TES        | 49.97  |\n| Women's singles | Short program  | PCS        | 37.56  |\n| Women's singles | Free skating   | TSS        | 185.29 |\n| Women's singles | Free skating   | TES        | 109.02 |\n| Women's singles | Free skating   | PCS        | 76.27  |\n| Pairs           | Combined total | TSS        | 239.88 |\n| Pairs           | Short program  | TSS        | 84.41  |\n| Pairs           | Short program  | TES        | 46.04  |\n| Pairs           | Short program  | PCS        | 38.45  |\n| Pairs           | Free skating   | TSS        | 157.46 |\n| Pairs           | Free skating   | TES        | 81.45  |\n| Pairs           | Free skating   | PCS        | 76.99  |\n| Ice dance       | Combined total | TSS        | 232.32 |\n| Ice dance       | Rhythm dance   | TSS        | 93.91  |\n| Ice dance       | Rhythm dance   | TES        | 55.16  |\n| Ice dance       | Rhythm dance   | PCS        | 39.57  |\n| Ice dance       | Free dance     | TSS        | 138.41 |\n| Ice dance       | Free dance     | TES        | 79.41  |\n| Ice dance       | Free dance     | PCS        | 59.70  |\n\n‎\npresent_date: 2025-03-25T01:53:58.336854\n\n\nMake sure to use the tools at your disposal to gather relevant information before providing your final probability estimate.\n\nYou may reason through the problem, but you MUST end your response with:\nFINAL PROBABILITY: [your decimal number between 0 and 1]"

We are pleased to bring you \\\"Predictions 2025,\\\" a special New Year's series sharing the foresight and expectations of selected contributors for the coming year in their fields of specialty, continuing with Jack Gallagher's forecast for figure skating.*\\n\\n**Next in the Series**\\n\\nDespite enjoying another banner year on the ice in 2024, there will be plenty of challenges in 2025 for Japanese skaters. Their nine medals at the combined Junior and Senior Grand Prix Final in December in Grenoble, France, [represented an all-time best for Japan](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/ice-time-grand-prix-final-bonanza-mao-shimada-leads-way-as-japan-gets-new-medal-mark/) at the prestigious event. However, only one of those medals was gold \\u30fc junior [Mao Shimada](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/mao-shimada/)'s.\\n\\nThe retirement of two-time world champion [Shoma Uno](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/shoma-uno/) after last season and the continued emergence of two American skaters ([Ilia Malinin](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/ilia-malinin/) and [Amber Glenn](https://www.isuresults.com/bios/isufs00034367.htm)) this campaign could well impact the success the Hinomaru enjoys at the world level this year.\\n\\nUno's retirement was not unexpected, but the ongoing growth of Malinin will make it difficult for a Japanese man to ascend to the top of skating in 2025. Beijing Olympic silver medalist [Yuma Kagiyama](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/yuma-kagiyama/) is the primary challenger to Malinin. But the 21-year-old Kagiyama will be the first to admit that the gap in their recent results has not been close.\\n\\n[Shun Sato](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/shun-sato/), [Kao Miura](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/kao-miura/) and [Tatsuya Tsuboi](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/tatsuya-tsuboi/) will be vying to join Kagiyama on the 2026 Olympic team during the 2025 season. Their maturation over the next 12 months will be a key to whether the Japan men can win multiple medals at the 2025 World Figure Skating Championships in Boston.\\n\\nSato, Miura and Tsuboi are all capable of pulling off great skates, but lack the consistency and stability of Kagiyama.\\n\\n## Predictions for Sakamoto and Chiba\\n\\n[Kaori Sakamoto](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/kaori-sakamoto/) won her third consecutive world crown in 2024 but was unable to retain her title at the GP Final after being bested by the resurgent Glenn, who is riding her triple axel to new heights.\\n\\nThe 24-year-old Sakamoto claimed [her fourth consecutive title](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/kaori-sakamoto-rolls-to-4th-straight-title-at-the-japan-championships/) at the Japan Championships, which had to give her a boost going into 2025. Without the triple axel that Glenn possesses, however, a fourth straight world crown may be a tough hill to climb for the Kobe native.\\n\\n[Mone Chiba](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/mone-chiba/)'s emergence continued with a silver medal behind Glenn at the GP Final. However, she has now been in position to have a great result a few times the past few seasons, but seems to find a way not to. The 19-year-old Chiba's issue is not her skating, but rather her confidence to perform in the clutch.\\n\\nChiba who [won the Four Continents Championships](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/mone-chiba-wins-gold-at-four-continents-rinka-watanabe-claims-bronze/) in 2024, clearly has the skating skills to be a world medalist. The real question is whether she has the fortitude to do it. We will find out in March.\\n\\n## Matsuike and Higuchi Plagued by Inconsistency\\n\\n[Rino Matsuike](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/rino-matsuike/) and [Wakaba Higuchi](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/wakaba-higuchi/) have excelled at times during the 2024-25 season, but can't be relied on for consistent results. After medaling at both of her GP events in 2024, [Hana Yoshida](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/hana-yoshida/)'s fifth-place finish at the GP Final and coming in 11th at the Japan Championships represents cause for concern.\\n\\nWith two-time world junior champion Shimada not eligible to compete at the 2026 Olympics due to her age, the battle for the berths for Milan among the senior Japanese women will be intense. Sakamoto looks like the only lock at this point.\\n\\n[Rika Kihira](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/rika-kihira/) retains hopes of a comeback in 2025. But after missing most of the past four seasons due to injury, it is hard to envision a realistic path back for the two-time Japan champion. So much time has gone by that even at 22 it looks like Kihira's time may have sadly passed.\\n\\n## Predictions: Expect a Banner Year for Japan's Juniors\\n\\nThe outlook for both Japan's junior women and men is bright for the new year.\\n\\nShimada will be going for an unprecedented third straight world junior title in 2025 and will be a favorite to achieve the feat despite her struggles this season with her triple axel and quadruple toe loop. She [repeated as JGP Final champion in 2024](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/mao-shimada-wins-junior-grand-prix-final-for-3rd-consecutive-year/) and [claimed her fourth straight Japan junior title](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/mao-shimada-wins-a-record-4th-straight-title-at-the-japan-junior-championships/). And Shimada continued her impressive win streak in which she has never lost a competition she entered as a junior.\\n\\nFifteen-year-old [Kaoruko Wada](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/kaoruko-wada/) was a pleasant revelation in her international debut season with two medals during the JGP events and a silver behind Shimada at the JGP Final. [Ami Nakai](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/ami-nakai/) also netted two JGP medals and a bronze at the JGP Final in Japan's sweep.\\n\\nThough [Rio Nakata](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/rio-nakata/), now 16, could not defend his JGP Final title, he impressed by coming in second behind Kagiyama at December's Japan Championships.

We are pleased to bring you \\\"Predictions 2025,\\\" a special New Year's series sharing the foresight and expectations of selected contributors for the coming year in their fields of specialty, continuing with Jack Gallagher's forecast for figure skating.*\\n\\n**Next in the Series**\\n\\nDespite enjoying another banner year on the ice in 2024, there will be plenty of challenges in 2025 for Japanese skaters. Their nine medals at the combined Junior and Senior Grand Prix Final in December in Grenoble, France, [represented an all-time best for Japan](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/ice-time-grand-prix-final-bonanza-mao-shimada-leads-way-as-japan-gets-new-medal-mark/) at the prestigious event. However, only one of those medals was gold \\u000e junior [Mao Shimada](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/mao-shimada/)'s.\\n\\nThe retirement of two-time world champion [Shoma Uno](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/shoma-uno/) after last season and the continued emergence of two American skaters ([Ilia Malinin](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/ilia-malinin/) and [Amber Glenn](https://www.isuresults.com/bios/isufs00034367.htm)) this campaign could well impact the success the Hinomaru enjoys at the world level this year.\\n\\nUno's retirement was not unexpected, but the ongoing growth of Malinin will make it difficult for a Japanese man to ascend to the top of skating in 2025. Beijing Olympic silver medalist [Yuma Kagiyama](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/yuma-kagiyama/) is the primary challenger to Malinin. But the 21-year-old Kagiyama will be the first to admit that the gap in their recent results has not been close.\\n\\n[Shun Sato](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/shun-sato/), [Kao Miura](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/kao-miura/) and [Tatsuya Tsuboi](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/tatsuya-tsuboi/) will be vying to join Kagiyama on the 2026 Olympic team during the 2025 season. Their maturation over the next 12 months will be a key to whether the Japan men can win multiple medals at the 2025 World Figure Skating Championships in Boston.\\n\\nSato, Miura and Tsuboi are all capable of pulling off great skates, but lack the consistency and stability of Kagiyama.\\n\\n## Predictions for Sakamoto and Chiba\\n\\n[Kaori Sakamoto](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/kaori-sakamoto/) won her third consecutive world crown in 2024 but was unable to retain her title at the GP Final after being bested by the resurgent Glenn, who is riding her triple axel to new heights.\\n\\nThe 24-year-old Sakamoto claimed [her fourth consecutive title](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/kaori-sakamoto-rolls-to-4th-straight-title-at-the-japan-championships/) at the Japan Championships, which had to give her a boost going into 2025. Without the triple axel that Glenn possesses, however, a fourth straight world crown may be a tough hill to climb for the Kobe native.\\n\\n[Mone Chiba](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/mone-chiba/)'s emergence continued with a silver medal behind Glenn at the GP Final. However, she has now been in position to have a great result a few times the past few seasons, but seems to find a way not to. The 19-year-old Chiba's issue is not her skating, but rather her confidence to perform in the clutch.\\n\\nChiba who [won the Four Continents Championships](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/mone-chiba-wins-gold-at-four-continents-rinka-watanabe-claims-bronze/) in 2024, clearly has the skating skills to be a world medalist. The real question is whether she has the fortitude to do it. We will find out in March.\\n\\n## Matsuike and Higuchi Plagued by Inconsistency\\n\\n[Rino Matsuike](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/rino-matsuike/) and [Wakaba Higuchi](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/wakaba-higuchi/) have excelled at times during the 2024-25 season, but can't be relied on for consistent results. After medaling at both of her GP events in 2024, [Hana Yoshida](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/hana-yoshida/)'s fifth-place finish at the GP Final and coming in 11th at the Japan Championships represents cause for concern.\\n\\nWith two-time world junior champion Shimada not eligible to compete at the 2026 Olympics due to her age, the battle for the berths for Milan among the senior Japanese women will be intense. Sakamoto looks like the only lock at this point.\\n\\n[Rika Kihira](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/rika-kihira/) retains hopes of a comeback in 2025. But after missing most of the past four seasons due to injury, it is hard to envision a realistic path back for the two-time Japan champion. So much time has gone by that even at 22 it looks like Kihira's time may have sadly passed.\\n\\n## Predictions: Expect a Banner Year for Japan's Juniors\\n\\nThe outlook for both Japan's junior women and men is bright for the new year.\\n\\nShimada will be going for an unprecedented third straight world junior title in 2025 and will be a favorite to achieve the feat despite her struggles this season with her triple axel and quadruple toe loop. She [repeated as JGP Final champion in 2024](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/mao-shimada-wins-junior-grand-prix-final-for-3rd-consecutive-year/) and [claimed her fourth straight Japan junior title](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/mao-shimada-wins-a-record-4th-straight-title-at-the-japan-junior-championships/). And Shimada continued her impressive win streak in which she has never lost a competition she entered as a junior.\\n\\nFifteen-year-old [Kaoruko Wada](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/kaoruko-wada/) was a pleasant revelation in her international debut season with two medals during the JGP events and a silver behind Shimada at the JGP Final. [Ami Nakai](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/ami-nakai/) also netted two JGP medals and a bronze at the JGP Final in Japan's sweep.\\n\\nThough [Rio Nakata](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/rio-nakata/), now 16, could not defend his JGP Final title, he impressed by coming in second behind Kagiyama at December's Japan Championships. Nakata will also not be age-eligible to compete in the 2026 Olympics but appears poised for continued success on the junior circuit.\\n\\n[Sena Takahashi](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/sena-takahashi/), who will turn 15 on January 29, enjoyed a fine international debut campaign. He medaled at both of his JGPs, was second at the Japan Junior Championships, and took fourth at the JGP Final. Fans can expect more solid results from him in 2025.\\n\\n## Miura and Kihara Eyeing a 2nd World Title\\n\\nPairs [Riku Miura](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/riku-miura/) and [Ryuichi Kihara](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/ryuichi-kihara/), world champions in 2023, will look to climb back to the top of the world podium in March. After winning their opening GP this season, they were second at both the NHK Trophy and the GP Final.\\n\\nMiura and Kihara appeared to be struggling to regain their top form after he was injured last season and they got off to a late start, though they still earned the silver medal at the 2024 world championships.\\n\\n## RELATED:\\n\\n*Read other predictions from our series,**Predictions 2025**Follow Ice Time and other figure skating news**on SportsLook**.**Predictions 2024: Japan's Figure Skaters Set to Continue Run of Success*\\n\\n\\nAuthor: [Jack Gallagher](https://featured.japan-forward.com/sportslook/tag/jack-gallagher/)\\n\\n*The author is a veteran sports journalist and one of the world's foremost figure skating experts.

The Program Components Score evaluates five aspects of the performance: skating skills, transitions, performance, composition, and interpretation of music, with judges awarding points on a scale of 0.25 to 10.00 in each category.\\n\\nThe TES and PCS are added together to form the Total Segment Score (TSS), which is calculated for both short programs and free skating and added together to determine an athlete's final ranking.\", \"resolution_criteria\": \"This question will resolve as Yes if in the 2025 World Figure Skating Championships, there is a new world record in any category (men's singles, women's singles, pairs, ice dance), for any segment, on any of the possible scores: TES – Technical element score, PCS – Program component score, TSS – Total segment score, Combine Total TSS across segments.\", \"fine_print\": \"If at least half of the 2025 World Figure Skating Championships events do not take place before April 7, 2025, this question will be annulled. In case a performance setting a new record is announced, but has not been officially verified (in case of potential disputes), it will count for the purposes of this question if it has not been cancelled as of April 7, 2025.\", \"present_date\": \"2025-03-25T01:53:58.336854\", \"date_cutoff_start\": null, \"date_cutoff_end\": null, \"scoring_weight\": 1.0, \"resolution\": \"unknown\", \"resolved_at\": null, \"max_facts\": 5}"

      "content": "Based on the gathered information, here are some key points that influence the probability of a new world record being set at the 2025 World Figure Skating Championships:\n\n1. **High-Level Competition**: The 2025 World Figure Skating Championships will feature 200 athletes from 50 countries, showcasing top talent in men's singles, women's singles, pairs, and ice dance. The presence of top skaters like Ilia Malinin, Kaori Sakamoto, and Amber Glenn, who have been performing at high levels, increases the likelihood of record-breaking performances.\n\n2. **Recent Performances**: Ilia Malinin is noted for his ongoing growth and technical prowess, which could lead to high scores. Amber Glenn, known for her triple axel, has recently bested Kaori Sakamoto at the Grand Prix Final, indicating strong competitive form.\n\n3. **Historical Context**: The event will be held in Boston, a familiar location for some athletes, which might provide a psychological advantage. The last time Boston hosted the World Championships was in 2016.\n\n4. **Anticipation and Preparation**: The championships are highly anticipated, with recent competitions like the ISU Four Continents Championships and the Grand Prix Final providing benchmarks for the athletes' current form.\n\n5. **Potential for Records**: The presence of skaters who are capable of executing high-difficulty elements, such as the triple axel and quadruple jumps, increases the potential for setting new records in TES, PCS, or TSS.\n\nGiven these factors, the probability of a new world record being set at the 2025 World Figure Skating Championships is reasonably high.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.65"
