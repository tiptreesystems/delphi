These tools can roughly be divided into indicators and chart patterns. When trying to make a Northrop Grumman stock forecast, traders also try to identify important support and resistance levels, which can give an indication of when a downtrend is likely to slow down and when an uptrend is likely to stall.\n\n### Northrop Grumman Stock Forecast Indicators\n\nMoving averages are among the most popular Northrop Grumman stock prediction tools. As the name suggests, a moving average provides the average closing price for NOC stock over a selected time frame, which is divided into a number of periods of the same length. For example, a 12-day simple moving average for NOC is a sum of NOC’s closing prices over the last 12 days which is then divided by 12.\n\nIn addition to the simple moving average (SMA), traders also use another type of moving average called the exponential moving average (EMA). The EMA gives more weight to more recent prices, and therefore reacts more quickly to recent price action.\n\n50-day, 100-day and 200-day moving averages are among the most commonly used indicators in the stock market to identify important resistance and support levels. If the Northrop Grumman stock price moves above any of these averages, it is generally seen as a bullish sign for Northrop Grumman stock. Conversely, a drop below an important moving average is usually interpreted as a negative forecast for the NOC market.\n\nTraders also like to use the RSI and Fibonacci retracement level indicators to try and ascertain the future direction of the Northrop Grumman stock price.\n\n### How to read Northrop Grumman stock charts and forecast price movements?\n\nWhen making a Northrop Grumman stock forecast, most traders use candlestick charts, as they provide more information than a simple line chart. Traders can view candlesticks that represent the price action of Northrop Grumman stock with different granularity – for example, you could choose a 5-minute candlestick chart for extremel…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 400 words out of ~775.

As the name suggests, a moving average provides the average closing price for NOC stock over a selected time frame, which is divided into a number of periods of the same length. For example, a 12-day simple moving average for NOC is a sum of NOC’s closing prices over the last 12 days which is then divided by 12.\n\nIn addition to the simple moving average (SMA), traders also use another type of moving average called the exponential moving average (EMA). The EMA gives more weight to more recent prices, and therefore reacts more quickly to recent price action.\n\n50-day, 100-day and 200-day moving averages are among the most commonly used indicators in the stock market to identify important resistance and support levels. If the Northrop Grumman stock price moves above any of these averages, it is generally seen as a bullish sign for Northrop Grumman stock. Conversely, a drop below an important moving average is usually interpreted as a negative forecast for the NOC market.\n\nTraders also like to use the RSI and Fibonacci retracement level indicators to try and ascertain the future direction of the Northrop Grumman stock price.\n\n### How to read Northrop Grumman stock charts and forecast price movements?\n\nWhen making a Northrop Grumman stock forecast, most traders use candlestick charts, as they provide more information than a simple line chart.

These tools can roughly be divided into indicators and chart patterns. When trying to make a Northrop Grumman stock forecast, traders also try to identify important support and resistance levels, which can give an indication of when a downtrend is likely to slow down and when an uptrend is likely to stall.\\n\\n### Northrop Grumman Stock Forecast Indicators\\n\\nMoving averages are among the most popular Northrop Grumman stock prediction tools. As the name suggests, a moving average provides the average closing price for NOC stock over a selected time frame, which is divided into a number of periods of the same length. For example, a 12-day simple moving average for NOC is a sum of NOC\\u2019s closing prices over the last 12 days which is then divided by 12.\\n\\nIn addition to the simple moving average (SMA), traders also use another type of moving average called the exponential moving average (EMA). The EMA gives more weight to more recent prices, and therefore reacts more quickly to recent price action.\\n\\n50-day, 100-day and 200-day moving averages are among the most commonly used indicators in the stock market to identify important resistance and support levels. If the Northrop Grumman stock price moves above any of these averages, it is generally seen as a bullish sign for Northrop Grumman stock. Conversely, a drop below an important moving average is usually interpreted as a negative forecast for the NOC market.\\n\\nTraders also like to use the RSI and Fibonacci retracement level indicators to try and ascertain the future direction of the Northrop Grumman stock price.\\n\\n### How to read Northrop Grumman stock charts and forecast price movements?\\n\\nWhen making a Northrop Grumman stock forecast, most traders use candlestick charts, as they provide more information than a simple line chart. Traders can view candlesticks that represent the price action of Northrop Grumman stock with different granularity \\u2013 for example, you could choose a 5-minute candlestick chart for extremel\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 400 words out of ~775.
