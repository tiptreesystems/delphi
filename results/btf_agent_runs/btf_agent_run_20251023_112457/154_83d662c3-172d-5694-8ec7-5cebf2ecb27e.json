  "question": "Will the USDA-posted recall by UP Products, LLC, DBA Meyer Wholesale of Ready-To-Eat and Raw Sausage Products issued January 13, 2025 be closed before April 1, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.6,
  "reasoning": "To assess the probability of the USDA-posted recall by UP Products, LLC being closed before April 1, 2025, I have gathered the following information:\n\n1. **Recall Details**: The recall involves approximately 400 pounds of sausage products due to misbranding and undeclared soy allergen. The products were produced between October 30, 2024, and January 7, 2025. The recall was announced by the USDA's FSIS on January 13, 2025. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. The products were distributed to locations in Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\n2. **Average Duration of Recalls**: Unfortunately, I couldn't find specific data on the average duration of USDA recalls. However, based on general knowledge, the duration of recalls can vary significantly depending on the severity and nature of the issue. Since this recall involves an undeclared allergen, it might be resolved relatively quickly if the issue is straightforward to address.\n\n3. **Current Status**: As of February 27, 2025, there is no specific update indicating that the recall status has changed from Active to Closed. However, the lack of adverse reactions and the nature of the issue (undeclared allergen) suggest that the resolution could be expedited.\n\nGiven these factors, I estimate a moderate probability that the recall will be closed before April 1, 2025. The absence of adverse reactions and the straightforward nature of the issue (undeclared allergen) are positive indicators for a timely resolution.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.6",

The following products are subject to recall:\n\n- 5\" x 8\" vacuum-sealed packages containing “Otto Meyer's Premium Sausage POLISH SAUSAGE” with lot codes 24304, 24318, 24326, 24346 on a sticker.\n- Bulk packed in 12\" x 24\" clear bags containing “Otto Meyer's Premium Sausage POTATO SAUSAGE” with dates 1/6/25, and 1/7/25 handwritten on the label.\n\nThe products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST.

These items were shipped to a restaurant and retail locations in Michigan, and a retail location in Wisconsin.\n\nThe problem was discovered during routine FSIS in-plant verification activities when FSIS personnel observed that soy, a known allergen, was being used as an ingredient and was not declared on the finished product label.\n\nThere have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an illness should contact a healthcare provider.\n\nFSIS is concerned that some product may be in consumer's, retailer's and restaurants' refrigerators or freezers. Restaurants, retailers and consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to serve, sell, or consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase."

For recall classification purposes, the causes were separated into 2 overall categories consisting of product contaminants or processing issues. The product contaminants category was further separated into 5 groups: allergens, biological contaminants, chemical contaminants, foreign objects, and undeclared food colors. The processing issues category was separated into 6 groups: cGMP issues, HACCP issues, manufacturing issues, mislabeling or misbranding, refrigeration issues, and under-processing. Product contaminants accounted for 91% of the F&B recalls, while processing issues accounted for the remaining 9%. Two groups accounted for about 76% of the recalls: biological contamination and allergens. The FDA classifies recalls by the potential severity of the health impact. Over half of the F&B recalls were Class I recalls, and biological contamination and allergens accounted for 96% of those recalls. Listeria monocytogenes was the largest cause of all of the recalls accounting for 7,844 recalls: 22% of the total recalls and 45% of the biological contamination recalls. Salmonella serovars were responsible for 6,597 recalls, including 18% of the total recalls and 38% of the biological recalls. Listeria and Salmonella serovars together resulted in 40% of all of the F&B recalls."

For recall classification purposes, the causes were separated into 2 overall categories consisting of product contaminants or processing issues. The product contaminants category was further separated into 5 groups: allergens, biological contaminants, chemical contaminants, foreign objects, and undeclared food colors. The processing issues category was separated into 6 groups: cGMP issues, HACCP issues, manufacturing issues, mislabeling or misbranding, refrigeration issues, and under-processing. Product contaminants accounted for 91% of the F&B recalls, while processing issues accounted for the remaining 9%. Two groups accounted for about 76% of the recalls: biological contamination and allergens. The FDA classifies recalls by the potential severity of the health impact. Over half of the F&B recalls were Class I recalls, and biological contamination and allergens accounted for 96% of those recalls. Listeria monocytogenes was the largest cause of all of the recalls accounting for 7,844 recalls: 22% of the total recalls and 45% of the biological contamination recalls. Salmonella serovars were responsible for 6,597 recalls, including 18% of the total recalls and 38% of the biological recalls. Listeria and Salmonella serovars together resulted in 40% of all of the F&B recalls.\", \"word_count\": 332, \"snippet_word_count\": 332, \"snippet_truncated\": false, \"date_cutoff_start\": \"2025-01-30T15:45:19.069849\", \"date_cutoff_end\": \"2025-02-28T15:45:19.069849\", \"cached_at\": \"2025-10-24T05:45:31.337025\"}",

      "content": "To assess the probability of the USDA-posted recall by UP Products, LLC being closed before April 1, 2025, I have gathered the following information:\n\n1. **Recall Details**: The recall involves approximately 400 pounds of sausage products due to misbranding and undeclared soy allergen. The products were produced between October 30, 2024, and January 7, 2025. The recall was announced by the USDA's FSIS on January 13, 2025. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. The products were distributed to locations in Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\n2. **Average Duration of Recalls**: Unfortunately, I couldn't find specific data on the average duration of USDA recalls. However, based on general knowledge, the duration of recalls can vary significantly depending on the severity and nature of the issue. Since this recall involves an undeclared allergen, it might be resolved relatively quickly if the issue is straightforward to address.\n\n3. **Current Status**: As of February 27, 2025, there is no specific update indicating that the recall status has changed from Active to Closed. However, the lack of adverse reactions and the nature of the issue (undeclared allergen) suggest that the resolution could be expedited.\n\nGiven these factors, I estimate a moderate probability that the recall will be closed before April 1, 2025. The absence of adverse reactions and the straightforward nature of the issue (undeclared allergen) are positive indicators for a timely resolution.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.6"
