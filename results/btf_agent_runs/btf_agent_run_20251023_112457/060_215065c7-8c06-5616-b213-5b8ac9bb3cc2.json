  "question": "Will Doge claim a total savings of $150 billion or more on April 1, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.2,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here's the analysis:\n\n1. **Current Savings Reported**: As of March 11, 2025, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) reports an estimated total savings of $115 billion. This figure includes savings from asset sales, contract and lease cancellations, fraud and improper payment deletion, grant cancellations, and other measures.\n\n2. **Skepticism and Criticism**: Multiple sources, including NPR and Fortune, have expressed skepticism about the accuracy of DOGE's claimed savings. The figures are suggested to be inflated, and there are inaccuracies in the reported data.\n\n3. **Rate of Savings**: DOGE's current savings claims are significantly below the pace needed to reach $150 billion by April 1, 2025. Elon Musk has stated that DOGE needs to save $4 billion per day to meet its ambitious goal of $1 trillion by the end of the fiscal year, but current efforts are falling short.\n\n4. **Challenges in Achieving Target**: Given the current savings of $115 billion and the skepticism about the accuracy and potential for further savings, it seems unlikely that DOGE will claim a total savings of $150 billion or more by the target date.\n\nConsidering these factors, the probability that DOGE will claim a total savings of $150 billion or more on April 1, 2025, is low.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.2",

But it's not looking at big spending drivers\n\nElon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency have an ambitious goal of cutting $1 trillion in federal spending by the end of the fiscal year in September.\n\nBut DOGE's moves so far to cancel contracts, end leases and push federal agencies to reduce their workforces barely make a dent in the government's overall balance sheet — even if you take DOGE's savings claims at face value.\n\nAnd as [NPR has reported](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/01/nx-s1-5313853/doge-savings-receipts-musk-trump), those early DOGE savings claims have been inaccurate and drastically overstated.\n\nIn Congress, where decisions about trillions of dollars in spending are debated and authorized in appropriations bills, House Republicans have [approved a framework](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/25/nx-s1-5308067/house-republicans-budget-vote-mike-johnson) that would include $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and a goal of $2 trillion in spending cuts. There are several more steps until legislation like that could get final approval.\n\nIt's through congressional action, not DOGE, where any changes to spending and revenue collection would happen at a meaningful scale, said Jessica Riedl of the center-right Manhattan Institute.\n\n\"Think of Congress and its budget as the debt-ridden dad on the way to buy a $250,000 Ferrari on the credit card, and DOGE is the $2-off gas card he used along the way,\" Riedl said. \"It's great that he saved $2 on gas, but I think his wife may be more concerned about the $250,000 car.\"\n\n### DOGE's alleged savings are a drop in the budget bucket\n\nFor every dollar that the federal government has spent so far since the start of this fiscal year in October 2024, DOGE — which began operating in mid-January — has claimed to save the equivalent of about four pennies.\n\nFrom Oct. 1, 2024, through Jan. 31, 2025, the federal government collected [$1.6 trillion](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/governmen…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 366 words out of ~905.

But it's not looking at big spending drivers\\n\\nElon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency have an ambitious goal of cutting $1 trillion in federal spending by the end of the fiscal year in September.\\n\\nBut DOGE's moves so far to cancel contracts, end leases and push federal agencies to reduce their workforces barely make a dent in the government's overall balance sheet \\u2014 even if you take DOGE's savings claims at face value.\\n\\nAnd as [NPR has reported](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/01/nx-s1-5313853/doge-savings-receipts-musk-trump), those early DOGE savings claims have been inaccurate and drastically overstated.\\n\\nIn Congress, where decisions about trillions of dollars in spending are debated and authorized in appropriations bills, House Republicans have [approved a framework](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/25/nx-s1-5308067/house-republicans-budget-vote-mike-johnson) that would include $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and a goal of $2 trillion in spending cuts. There are several more steps until legislation like that could get final approval.\\n\\nIt's through congressional action, not DOGE, where any changes to spending and revenue collection would happen at a meaningful scale, said Jessica Riedl of the center-right Manhattan Institute.\\n\\n\\\"Think of Congress and its budget as the debt-ridden dad on the way to buy a $250,000 Ferrari on the credit card, and DOGE is the $2-off gas card he used along the way,\\\" Riedl said. \\\"It's great that he saved $2 on gas, but I think his wife may be more concerned about the $250,000 car.\\\"\\n\\n### DOGE's alleged savings are a drop in the budget bucket\\n\\nFor every dollar that the federal government has spent so far since the start of this fiscal year in October 2024, DOGE \\u2014 which began operating in mid-January \\u2014 has claimed to save the equivalent of about four pennies.\\n\\nFrom Oct. 1, 2024, through Jan. 31, 2025, the federal government collected [$1.6 trillion](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/governmen\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 366 words out of ~905.

This figure includes savings from asset sales, contract and lease cancellations, fraud and improper payment deletion, grant cancellations, and other measures.\n\n2. **Skepticism and Criticism**: Multiple sources, including NPR and Fortune, have expressed skepticism about the accuracy of DOGE's claimed savings. The figures are suggested to be inflated, and there are inaccuracies in the reported data.\n\n3. **Rate of Savings**: DOGE's current savings claims are significantly below the pace needed to reach $150 billion by April 1, 2025. Elon Musk has stated that DOGE needs to save $4 billion per day to meet its ambitious goal of $1 trillion by the end of the fiscal year, but current efforts are falling short.\n\n4. **Challenges in Achieving Target**: Given the current savings of $115 billion and the skepticism about the accuracy and potential for further savings, it seems unlikely that DOGE will claim a total savings of $150 billion or more by the target date.\n\nConsidering these factors, the probability that DOGE will claim a total savings of $150 billion or more on April 1, 2025, is low.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.2"
