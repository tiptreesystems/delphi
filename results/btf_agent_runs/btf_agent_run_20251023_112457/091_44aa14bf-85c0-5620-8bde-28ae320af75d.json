  "question": "Will the total number of likes made on Bluesky on March 30, 2025 be between 20 million and 35 million?",
  "probability": 0.75,
  "reasoning": "Based on the information gathered:\n\n1. **User Base and Activity**: Bluesky has experienced significant growth, with over 27 million users as of early 2025. The platform has around 3.2 to 3.5 million daily active users, primarily in the US and UK. The user base is increasing rapidly, with approximately 466.5k new users daily.\n\n2. **Engagement Metrics**: Users have liked a combined total of 2.9 billion posts so far. This indicates a high level of engagement on the platform. Features like reply controls, profile search, trending topics, and a dedicated video tab have been introduced to potentially boost user interaction and content visibility.\n\n3. **Growth Trends**: The platform's user base and engagement metrics have shown a consistent upward trend, with significant increases in both registered users and daily active users. The introduction of new features is likely to sustain or even accelerate this growth.\n\n4. **Resolution Criteria**: The question resolves as YES if the number of likes on March 30, 2025, is between 20 million and 35 million. Given the current engagement levels and growth trends, it is plausible that the daily likes could fall within this range.\n\nConsidering the rapid growth in user base and engagement, along with the introduction of new features to enhance user interaction, it is reasonable to estimate a high probability that the number of likes on March 30, 2025, will be between 20 million and 35 million.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.75",

      "content": "Based on the information gathered:\n\n1. **User Base and Activity**: Bluesky has experienced significant growth, with over 27 million users as of early 2025. The platform has around 3.2 to 3.5 million daily active users, primarily in the US and UK. The user base is increasing rapidly, with approximately 466.5k new users daily.\n\n2. **Engagement Metrics**: Users have liked a combined total of 2.9 billion posts so far. This indicates a high level of engagement on the platform. Features like reply controls, profile search, trending topics, and a dedicated video tab have been introduced to potentially boost user interaction and content visibility.\n\n3. **Growth Trends**: The platform's user base and engagement metrics have shown a consistent upward trend, with significant increases in both registered users and daily active users. The introduction of new features is likely to sustain or even accelerate this growth.\n\n4. **Resolution Criteria**: The question resolves as YES if the number of likes on March 30, 2025, is between 20 million and 35 million. Given the current engagement levels and growth trends, it is plausible that the daily likes could fall within this range.\n\nConsidering the rapid growth in user base and engagement, along with the introduction of new features to enhance user interaction, it is reasonable to estimate a high probability that the number of likes on March 30, 2025, will be between 20 million and 35 million.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.75"
