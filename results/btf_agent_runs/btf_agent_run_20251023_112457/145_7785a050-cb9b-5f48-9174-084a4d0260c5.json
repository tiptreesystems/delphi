This suggests that the podcast is already performing well on the charts.\n\n2. **Content and Audience Engagement**: The podcast covers a wide range of popular topics such as pop culture, fashion, and personal anecdotes, which appeal to a broad audience. The ongoing production of episodes, with the latest released on March 18, 2025, indicates consistent engagement with listeners.\n\n3. **Live Tour and Media Exposure**: The podcast hosts, Hannah Berner and Paige DeSorbo, are currently on a U.S. tour with their comedy show, which could boost their visibility and attract more listeners. Additionally, Hannah Berner's recent appearance on ABC's The Bachelor and other media projects could further increase the podcast's audience.\n\n4. **Future Prospects**: There are plans to adapt the podcast into a show, which could expand its reach and attract new listeners. The hosts are actively involved in various media projects, which may enhance their personal brands and draw more attention to the podcast.\n\nGiven these factors, the Giggly Squad podcast is likely to maintain or improve its position on the Spotify Podcast Charts. The combination of a strong existing presence, active audience engagement, and increased visibility from the live tour and media appearances suggests a favorable outlook for ranking between positions 26 and 45 by March 31, 2025.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.65",

I don’t even know algebra,’ but I got to wear a tie, so I was very invested,” Berner told us. “I was bossing everyone around. My job [on the show] was to give girls money when they got answers right, but I didn’t even know when the answers were right or not, so I just gave them all a ton of money, so I felt like it was a success for everyone. I had so much fun because I’m a *Bachelor* fan. I’ve been watching since college.”\n\n### Watch on Deadline\n\nSince *The Bachelor* is on ABC, like *Dancing with the Stars*, we asked the comedian if she would ever see herself competing for the Mirrorball Trophy.\n\n“OK, I do have to say my husband did *Dancing with the Stars* in Ireland, and he loved it, and he talks about it. Maybe one day!” she said. “I do have to say I can’t touch my toes. so there would be no splits involved. I might just do the worm the entire time, which has never been done before. So I’d probably be out in the first round. Imagine I just do the worm every single and [the judges] are like ‘That’s not the waltz.'”\n\nBerner is a former tennis player who is quite competitive. We asked if The Traitors would be a good fit for her in the future, to which she said, “My good friend, Ciara [Miller from *Summer House*], is on *The Traitors* right now, and she’s killing it.”\n\n“I…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 428 words out of ~1035.
