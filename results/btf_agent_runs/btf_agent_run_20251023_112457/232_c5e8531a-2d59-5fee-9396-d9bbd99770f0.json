  "question": "Will a company other than Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, or Amazon be the world's most valuable company by market cap on March 29, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.1,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here is the current situation regarding the market capitalization of the world's largest companies as of March 2025:\n\n1. **Apple Inc.** consistently appears as the world's most valuable company, with market caps reported around $3.63 trillion to $3.9 trillion.\n2. **Nvidia Corporation** follows closely, with market caps ranging from $2.92 trillion to $3.4 trillion, having experienced significant growth due to the AI boom.\n3. **Microsoft Corporation** is also a major player, with market caps reported around $2.89 trillion to $2.95 trillion.\n4. **Amazon.com, Inc.** and **Alphabet Inc.** have market caps in the range of $2.02 trillion to $2.25 trillion.\n5. **Saudi Aramco** is the largest company outside the top five, with a market cap of approximately $1.79 trillion, but it is heavily dependent on oil prices.\n\nGiven this information, the top five companies (Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet) still dominate the market capitalization rankings. The likelihood of another company surpassing all five by March 29, 2025, seems low, especially considering the substantial lead Apple and Nvidia have over other competitors.\n\nConsidering the current market dynamics and the dominance of these tech giants, the probability that a company other than Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, or Amazon will be the world's most valuable company by market cap on March 29, 2025, is quite low.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1",

      "content": "Based on the following question, analyze it carefully and provide your probability estimate.\n\nQuestion: Will a company other than Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, or Amazon be the world's most valuable company by market cap on March 29, 2025?\nBackground: At the time of this question, the world's most valuable companies by market capitalization are led by Apple ($3.9 trillion), followed by Nvidia ($3.4 trillion), with Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon rounding out the top ranks. While these companies currently dominate, market dynamics could allow another company to rise to the top position. On March 29, 2025 (a Saturday), market caps will likely reflect completed stock market trading on March 28, 2025.\nResolution criteria: This question resolves as YES if any company OTHER than Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, or Amazon has the highest market capitalization shown by the CompaniesMarketCap website on March 29, 2025. It resolves as NO if any of these five named companies has the highest market capitalization on that date.\nFine print: In theory a company's market capitalization [is defined](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/market-capitalization) as the stock price multiplied by the number of outstanding shares. However, in practice the market cap figure can vary based on the source (typically due to disagreement over the number of outstanding shares). Therefore, the primary resolution source for this question will be https://companiesmarketcap.com/ regardless of what is shown at other sources. In the event of the primary source being down, the secondary source will be a manual calculation by multiplying the stock price by the number of outstanding shares shown on the most recent 10-Q or 10-K filing.\npresent_date: 2025-03-21T14:26:33.726845\n\n\nMake sure to use the tools at your disposal to gather relevant information before providing your final probability estimate.\n\nYou may reason through the problem, but you MUST end your response with:\nFINAL PROBABILITY: [your decimal number between 0 and 1]"

The likelihood of another company surpassing all five by March 29, 2025, seems low, especially considering the substantial lead Apple and Nvidia have over other competitors.\n\nConsidering the current market dynamics and the dominance of these tech giants, the probability that a company other than Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, or Amazon will be the world's most valuable company by market cap on March 29, 2025, is quite low.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1"
