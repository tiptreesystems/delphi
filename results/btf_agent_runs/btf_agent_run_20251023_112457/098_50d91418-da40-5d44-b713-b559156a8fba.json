  "question": "Will the total number of forecasters in the Q1 2025 Quarterly Cup be less than 400 forecasters?",
  "probability": 0.1,
  "reasoning": "Based on the information gathered, here is the analysis regarding the probability that the total number of forecasters in the Q1 2025 Quarterly Cup will be less than 400:\n\n1. **Historical Participation Data**: The participation in the Quarterly Cup has varied significantly over the past quarters, with numbers ranging from 379 to 1002 forecasters. The last quarter of 2024 saw a significant drop to 379 forecasters, likely due to a site rewrite.\n\n2. **Community Prediction**: The community prediction for the Q1 2025 Quarterly Cup is 563 forecasters, with a range between 466 and 676 forecasters. This prediction is based on community forecasts and suggests a higher participation than 400.\n\n3. **Impact of Other Tournaments**: The launch of other tournaments like ACX2025 and the Brazil Prediction Tournament has led to a record number of new users signing up on Metaculus. This influx of new users could potentially increase participation in the Quarterly Cup as well.\n\n4. **User Engagement**: The ACX2025 tournament and others have attracted significant attention, with large prize pools and a broad set of questions. This might draw forecasters to participate in multiple tournaments, including the Quarterly Cup.\n\n5. **Current Trends and Feedback**: There is no specific feedback indicating a continued decline in participation for the Quarterly Cup in Q1 2025. Instead, the trends suggest a recovery or increase in participation due to new user sign-ups and the excitement around new tournaments.\n\nConsidering these factors, the likelihood of the total number of forecasters being less than 400 seems low. The community prediction and the influx of new users suggest that participation will likely exceed this number.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1",

That means the 2025 contest is now open!\n\nThis year I had hoped to arrange some kind of fair comparison with Polymarket so I could prove my thesis that it usually underperforms Metaculus - but with all the excitement of the election and [the feds harassing Shayne](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/fbi-raids-polymarket-ceo-shayne-coplans-apartment-seizes-phone-source-rcna180180) we never got around to making it work.\n\nSo the aspect I’m most excited about this year is the bots. There are many new forecasting bots, some of them have been tested in slightly sketchy situations, and I want to see how they rank against some of ACX’s top forecasters.\n\nI’m also excited about the question set. This year I worked together with Metaculus to try to find issues that were both rigorous enough to judge fairly and of broad enough interest that everyone can weigh in (no “AI benchmark #44523, really!).\n\nI hope this (and the $10,000) are enough justification to encourage you to go through these questions for another year, even before you know how you did last time (we will tell you, soon, really!)\n\nSo ** go take the contest**, make some predictions, and I’ll meet you back here with the results in 2026!\n\n## Share this post"

      "content": "Based on the information gathered, here is the analysis regarding the probability that the total number of forecasters in the Q1 2025 Quarterly Cup will be less than 400:\n\n1. **Historical Participation Data**: The participation in the Quarterly Cup has varied significantly over the past quarters, with numbers ranging from 379 to 1002 forecasters. The last quarter of 2024 saw a significant drop to 379 forecasters, likely due to a site rewrite.\n\n2. **Community Prediction**: The community prediction for the Q1 2025 Quarterly Cup is 563 forecasters, with a range between 466 and 676 forecasters. This prediction is based on community forecasts and suggests a higher participation than 400.\n\n3. **Impact of Other Tournaments**: The launch of other tournaments like ACX2025 and the Brazil Prediction Tournament has led to a record number of new users signing up on Metaculus. This influx of new users could potentially increase participation in the Quarterly Cup as well.\n\n4. **User Engagement**: The ACX2025 tournament and others have attracted significant attention, with large prize pools and a broad set of questions. This might draw forecasters to participate in multiple tournaments, including the Quarterly Cup.\n\n5. **Current Trends and Feedback**: There is no specific feedback indicating a continued decline in participation for the Quarterly Cup in Q1 2025. Instead, the trends suggest a recovery or increase in participation due to new user sign-ups and the excitement around new tournaments.\n\nConsidering these factors, the likelihood of the total number of forecasters being less than 400 seems low. The community prediction and the influx of new users suggest that participation will likely exceed this number.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.1"
