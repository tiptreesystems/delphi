  "question": "Before April 1, 2025, will Donald Trump expresses his desire to run for a third term in 2028?",
  "probability": 0.3,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, Donald Trump has frequently mused about the possibility of running for a third term, despite the constitutional limitations. He has made public statements that suggest he is considering the idea, and he has engaged with audiences that support the notion, as evidenced by chants of \"Four more years!\" at events. However, these statements often come in the form of musings or jokes rather than explicit declarations of intent to run.\n\nThe resolution criteria for the question require Trump to explicitly express his desire to run for President again in 2028. While he has hinted at the idea and entertained the possibility, there is no clear evidence from the reviewed sources that he has made a definitive statement expressing a desire to run for a third term in a way that meets the resolution criteria.\n\nGiven the lack of a clear, explicit declaration from Trump that he intends to run for a third term, the probability that he will express such a desire before April 1, 2025, remains uncertain. However, his repeated musings and the context of his statements suggest a non-negligible chance that he might do so.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.3",

Primarily because he keeps bringing it up. It’s clearly on his mind, and Trump says what’s on his mind.\n\nBut why even spend time on something that seems like an unconstitutional fantasy?\n\nWell, there’s an emerging pattern among Trump supporters. When he says something off the wall or controversial, his backers chastise critics by saying, “Don’t be so sensitive. Of course, Trump isn’t going to do that.” But then when he does it, they say, “Well, of course he did it. He said he was going to do it. Why are you surprised? Get over it.”\n\nAfter seeing Trump in action for almost a decade, I take him seriously and literally.\n\n## Third term on his mind\n\nTrump was planting the seeds for a third term back [in August 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zxqjudN0_g), before he lost reelection. “We are going to win four more years. And then after that, we’ll go for another four years,” Trump told supporters in Wisconsin, explaining he should get a “re-do” because someone “spied on his [2016] campaign.”\n\nOver the past year, Trump has suggested multiple times that he could serve more than two terms. “FDR, 16 years — almost 16 years — he was four terms. I don’t know, are we going to be considered three-term? Or two-term?” he asked at [the National Rifle Association convention](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-speech-nra-leadership-forum-dallas-may-18-2024/) in May.\n\nThen after winning a second term, Trump [told House Republicans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74vcsDCfFlg) at a mid-November meeting: “I suspect I won’t be running again unless you say, ‘He’s so good we’ve got to figure something else out.’”\n\nAt a [rally last month in Las Vegas](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-speech-political-rally-las-vegas-january-25…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 363 words out of ~1175.

The Constitution’s 22nd Amendment limits presidents from holding the office more than twice.\n\nTrump’s suggestion before attendees of a Black History Month reception came after he mentioned “the next time” in a seeming reference to running again. He then cut off his own sentence to ask the audience if he should run another time. Met by shouts of affirmation, Trump basked in the attention, laughing and waving a hand at the audience.\n\n“There’s your controversy right there,” Trump responded, chuckling. “You’re going to see that tonight, Tim, on television,” referring to Sen. Tim Scott (R-South Carolina), who was in the audience at the reception.\n\nHours later, former Trump adviser Stephen K. Bannon led an audience to chant “We want Trump!” referring to the 2028 election while speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill, Maryland.\n\n“We want Trump in ’28,” Bannon said. “That’s what they can’t stand. A man like Trump comes along only once or twice in a country’s history. Right? We want Trump!”\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday evening.\n\nThe limits of Trump’s power — and whether he will heed them — have become a central theme of the first weeks of his presidency. Since taking office, Trump has[ moved rapidly](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/04/supreme-court-donald-trump-test-cases-presidential-authority/) to stretch the limits of presidential authority. The U.S. DOGE Service has triggered alarm among federal agencies for sweeping actions against them that i…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 369 words out of ~1176.

And he was giving himself “a 25-year period” to make the selections.\n\nA short time later, at a breakfast at a Washington hotel, Mr. Trump flicked again at the prospect that his time in office could extend beyond two four-year terms.\n\n“They say I can’t run again; that’s the expression,” he said. “Then somebody said, I don’t *think *you can. Oh.”\n\nJust eight days after he won a second term, Mr. Trump — whose supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in an effort to prevent Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s victory from being certified — mused about whether he could have a third presidential term, which is barred by the Constitution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[SKIP ADVERTISEMENT](https://www.nytimes.com#after-bottom)"

      "content": "Based on the gathered evidence, Donald Trump has frequently mused about the possibility of running for a third term, despite the constitutional limitations. He has made public statements that suggest he is considering the idea, and he has engaged with audiences that support the notion, as evidenced by chants of \"Four more years!\" at events. However, these statements often come in the form of musings or jokes rather than explicit declarations of intent to run.\n\nThe resolution criteria for the question require Trump to explicitly express his desire to run for President again in 2028. While he has hinted at the idea and entertained the possibility, there is no clear evidence from the reviewed sources that he has made a definitive statement expressing a desire to run for a third term in a way that meets the resolution criteria.\n\nGiven the lack of a clear, explicit declaration from Trump that he intends to run for a third term, the probability that he will express such a desire before April 1, 2025, remains uncertain. However, his repeated musings and the context of his statements suggest a non-negligible chance that he might do so.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.3"
