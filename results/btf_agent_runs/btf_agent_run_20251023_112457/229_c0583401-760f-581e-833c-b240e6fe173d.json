  "question": "Will the United Nations have exactly 193 member states on March 31, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.95,
  "reasoning": "Based on the information gathered:\n\n1. As of March 6, 2025, the United Nations has 193 member states, according to both the official UN website and Wikipedia.\n2. The number of UN member states has remained stable at 193 since 2011, with no new admissions or withdrawals since South Sudan joined in 2011.\n3. Joining the UN requires approval from both the Security Council and the General Assembly, which is a lengthy and complex process. There are no recent announcements or developments indicating changes in UN membership.\n4. The two non-member observer states, Vatican City and the State of Palestine, have not recently applied for full membership.\n\nGiven the stability in the number of UN member states and the absence of any indications of changes in the near future, it is highly probable that the number of member states will remain at 193 on March 31, 2025.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.95",
