  "question": "Will the total number of posts made on Bluesky on March 30, 2025 be less than 4 million?",
  "probability": 0.4,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here is a summary of the current state of Bluesky and its user engagement:\n\n1. **User Growth**: Bluesky has experienced rapid growth, with user numbers increasing from 13 million in late October 2024 to over 33 million by March 2025. The platform is growing at a rate of approximately 1 user per second, attracting around 466,500 new users daily.\n\n2. **Daily Active Users**: As of early 2025, Bluesky has around 3.5 million daily active users in the US and UK. The platform has a significant number of daily unique posters, estimated at around 1.3 million.\n\n3. **Posting Activity**: The total number of posts on Bluesky has reached 973.80 million, with users creating tens of thousands of posts daily. As of March 2025, approximately 1.18 million posts have been made, equating to about 35 posts per user.\n\n4. **Engagement**: User engagement is high, with average visit durations of around 9 to 10 minutes per session. The platform has introduced new features like reply controls, profile search, trending topics, and a video tab to boost user interaction and content creation.\n\n5. **Platform Enhancements**: Continuous updates and feature additions suggest an active effort by Bluesky to enhance user experience and engagement, which could lead to increased posting activity.\n\nGiven the rapid growth in user numbers and the high level of engagement, it seems plausible that the total number of posts made on Bluesky on March 30, 2025, could exceed 4 million. However, considering the current daily posting activity and the number of daily active users, it is also possible that the total posts could remain below this threshold.\n\n**FINAL PROBABILITY**: 0.4",

In this post, I’ll share 27 Bluesky statistics you need to know, covering users, demographics, and more….\nsitename: Adam Connell\ndate: 2025-01-16\n---\n# Bluesky Statistics For 2025 (Users, Demographics, Growth)\n\nLooking for the latest Bluesky statistics? You’re in the right place.\n\nBluesky is the app everyone’s talking about right now.\n\nFollowing a recent surge in user numbers, it’s become one of the fastest-growing social media platforms. This has led many to wonder if Bluesky will finally emerge as a serious competitor to rival platform X (formerly Twitter).\n\nIn this post, I’ll be sharing 27 stats that reveal more about Bluesky’s meteoric growth, its user demographics, and other interesting insights.\n\n## Top picks\n\n- Bluesky has 23.2 million total users and 3.2 million daily active users (Theo.io, Similarweb3)\n- Users visit the Bluesky website 75.8 million times monthly… (Similarweb)\n- …and download the Bluesky app 400k times daily (Appfigures)\n- Bluesky users have shared over 658 million posts in total (bsky.jazco.dev)\n- Bluesky users have followed accounts 1.1 billion times and liked posts 1.1 billion times (bsky.jazco.dev)\n- Bluesky (@bsky.app) is the most-followed account on the platform (VQV.APP)\n- Most Bluesky users are from Brazil (37.7%), the US (25.6%), and Japan (8.7%) (Similarweb, Bluesky1)\n\n## Bluesky user statistics\n\nFirst, let’s look at statistics that highlight how many people currently use Bluesky, how those numbers have changed over time, and the factors that are driving its growth.\n\n### 1. Bluesky has over 23.2 million total registered users…\n\nAt the time of writing, around 23.2 million people have signed up for Bluesky—and that figure is changing rapidly. By the time you read this post, it may be significantly higher.\n\nBluesky still has a long way to go to catch up to rival platform X, which is the 11th [most-used social media platform](https://adamconnell.me/social-media-platforms/) with 619 million users. However, if Bluesky maintains its current momentum, it may begin to close that gap over the next few years.\n\nSource: Theo.io\n\n### 2. …that’s up from just 1 million users last year…\n\nSince raising their seed round in 2023, Bluesky has gone from an invite-only app with a modest 1 million users to an open app with more than 23.2 million users from all over the world…and counting!\n\nWhat’s more, most of those new users signed up in just the last few months alone. Bluesky had just 5 million users as of March 2024. And an incredible 2.6 million new users registered within just a few days at the start of September 2024.\n\nSource: Bluesky6\n\n### 3. …and is increasing by 5.4 users per second\n\nAccording to theo.io’s user counter, 5.4 users are registering for Bluesky every second (at the time of writing). That works out to 324 new users a minute, 19,440 new users an hour, and roughly 466.5k new users a day.\n\nThe rate at which new users sign up for the platform is constantly changing—and it’s been even faster in the past. At one point in November this year, Bluesky was adding roughly a million new users a day.\n\nSource: Theo.io, Bluesky5\n\n### 4. Bluesky has around 3.2 million daily active users (DAUs) in the US\n\nAs of mid-November 2024, around 3.2 million people in the US use Bluesky daily. That number has ticked up dramatically over the last month.\n\nSite: Similarweb3\n\n### 5. Bluesky usage in the US is up 500% since election day\n\nThe US election served as a catalyst for the ongoing exodus of users from Bluesky’s rival social media app, X.\n\nMany liberal users expressed concerns about misinformation on the platform, as well as concerns that X was used as a vehicle to help with the Republican’s election campaign due to owner Elon Musk’s political leanings and close ties to the Trump administration.\n\nAs a result, liberal users have been leaving X in droves—and many of them have found their way to Bluesky, which has caused this recent surge in usage. Aside from the US, Bluesky usage is also up 350% in the UK since the US election.\n\nSite: Similarweb3\n\n### 6. Bluesky gained 3 million new users the week after X was suspended in Brazil…\n\nEarlier this year, Brazil’s Supreme Court suspended X. As a result, Brazilians who could no longer access X signed up for Bluesky instead, which led to one of the biggest leaps in user numbers Bluesky has seen to date.\n\nSource: Bluesky7\n\n### 7. …and 1.2 million new users in the days following the announcement that X would change the ‘block’ feature\n\nEarlier this year, X made the controversial decision to change its block feature so that users could still see content from accounts they’d blocked—a change that was widely criticized.\n\nAgain, Bluesky was well-positioned to capitalize on this as 1.2 million disgruntled users who left X as a result of the change signed up for Bluesky instead.\n\nSource: Bluesky8\n\n### 8. There are over 671 million posts on Bluesky\n\n…and counting! Users create tens of thousands of posts every day, so by the time you’re reading this, there are probably already millions more.\n\nSource: bsky.jazco.dev\n\n### 9. There are around 1.3 million daily unique posters on Bluesky\n\nThis varies every day, but it’s somewhere around that ballpark at the time of writing (November 2024).\n\nNotably, that’s significantly higher than last month, when there were just 293k unique daily posters.\n\nSource: bsky.jazco.dev\n\n## Bluesky engagement statistics\n\nNext, let’s look at some more Bluesky statistics about how users engage with content and accounts on the platform.\n\n### 10. There are over 1.1 billion total followers across all Bluesky accounts…\n\nThat’s the number you get if you add up the followers of every user on Bluesky.\n\nSource: bsky.jazco.dev\n\n### 11. …and over 2.9 billion total likes\n\nUsers on Bluesky have liked a combined total of 2.9 billion posts so far… and counting!\n\nSource: bsky.jazco.dev\n\n### 12. 50% of Bluesky users only have 1 follower\n\nAs Bluesky is still in its infancy, few users on the platform have managed to gain a significant number of followers (yet). Around half of all Bluesky users only have a single follower, and only the top 0.01% have accrued over 10k followers.\n\nPercentage of accounts | Number of followers |\n| 50% | 1+ |\n| 25% | 6+ |\n| 10% | 34+ |\n| 5% | 85+ |\n| 1% | 400+ |\n| 0.1% | 2,238+ |\n| 0.01% | 11,241+ |\n\n*Related: **How To Grow Your Social Media Following The Right Way*\n\nSource: bsky.jazco.dev\n\n### 13. The most followed account on Bluesky is… Bluesky!\n\nWhen you sign up for Bluesky, you automatically follow Bluesky (@bsky.app) by default. So unsurprisingly, Bluesky is the most-followed account on the platform with 15.9 million followers.\n\nThe table below shows the rest of the top-5 most-followed accounts on the platform at the time of writing.\n\nTop 5 most-followed Bluesky accounts | Number of followers |\n| Bluesky (@bsky.app) | 15.9 million |\n| Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@aoc.bsky.social) | 914,000 |\n| George Takei (@georgetakei.bsky.social) | 797,000 |\n| The New York Times (@nytimes.com) | 725,000 |\n| The Onion (@theonion.com) | 704,000 |\n\nSource: VQV.APP\n\n### 14. The most-liked post on Bluesky has 242.3k likes\n\nAccording to Bluesky’s feed of most popular posts on platforms by likes, the most-liked post is from Bluesky themselves (@bsky.app), in which they celebrate reaching a million new users.\n\nThe second most-liked post is another celebratory post from Bluesky (222.3k likes), and the third is from Mark Hamill (@markhamillofficial.bsky.social) with a joke about quitting Twitter (170.1k likes).\n\nSource: Bluesky2\n\n### 15. There are over 50,000 custom feeds on Bluesky\n\nOne of the things that differentiates Bluesky from competitors like X is that it offers ‘algorithmic choice’ by letting users create their own custom feeds to determine what content they see.\n\nAlternatively, they can deploy custom feeds that other users have created from the open marketplace. Over 50k custom feeds have been built so far.\n\n## Bluesky traffic & app downloads\n\nBelow you’ll find traffic statistics from Similarweb that reveal insights about Bluesky’s website visitors.\n\n### 16. People visited the Bluesky website over 75.8 million times last month\n\nAccording to Similarweb’s traffic data, the Bluesky website (bsky.app) had around 75.8 million total website visits. Note that this doesn’t mean Bluesky had over 75.8 million *unique *visitors—many of those visits will be repeat visits from the same users.\n\nSource: Similarweb\n\n### 17. The average visit duration for Bluesky is 9 minutes, 46 seconds\n\nThis should be a fairly good indication of the typical Bluesky session duration, i.e. how long the average user stays on Bluesky when they open the app/website.\n\nSource: Similarweb\n\n### 18. Bluesky is downloaded around 400k times a day\n\nAt the time of writing, Bluesky is downloaded around 400k times per day, on average. It overtook X (which has 250k daily downloads, on average) for the first time this month (November 2024).\n\nSource: Appfigures\n\n### 19. Bluesky was downloaded 3.2 million times last month\n\nUsers downloaded Bluesky around 3.2 million times in October 2024. That figure was even higher in September at 5.1 million.\n\nSource: Similarweb2\n\n### 20. Bluesky was downloaded over 9 million times in the second half of 2024\n\nAnd we’re not even at the end of the year yet, so expect that figure to increase. In comparison, Bluesky was downloaded only 1.4 million times in the first half of 2024.\n\nSource: Business of Apps\n\n### 21. Bluesky recently became the #1 top-performing app in the App Store\n\nIn November 2024, Bluesky became the #1 app in Apple’s App Store charts, with rival Threads in the #2 spot. The App Store charts rank apps based on download and revenue velocity, which suggests Bluesky is one of the fastest-growing apps this month.\n\nSource: Forbes, Apple\n\n## Bluesky demographics\n\nWhat demographics make up Bluesky’s user base? Let’s look at some more Bluesky statistics to find out.\n\n### 22. 64% of Bluesky users are male\n\nAlmost two-thirds of those who visit Bluesky are male (64%), while only a little over one-third are female (36%). This is based on traffic data from Similarweb as Bluesky hasn’t publicly shared its own internal data about user demographics.\n\nSource: Similarweb\n\n### 23. 42% of Bluesky users are 18 to 24 years old\n\nIt seems that Bluesky primarily appeals to younger users. According to Similarweb’s traffic data, around 42% of visitors to the site are between the ages of 18 to 24.\n\nAge | % of Bluesky website traffic |\n| 18-24 | 42% |\n| 25-34 | 27.5% |\n| 35-44 | 13.3% |\n| 45-54 | 7.7% |\n| 55-64 | 5.6% |\n| 65+ | 3.8% |\n\nSource: Similarweb\n\n### 24. 37.7% of Bluesky’s traffic comes from Brazil\n\nAccording to Similarweb, Brazil accounts for a greater portion of Bluesky’s website traffic than any other country. It’s followed by the US (25.6%), Japan (8.7%), and the UK (3.8%).\n\nBluesky’s Jay (@jay.bsky.team) also confirmed in a recent post that the US, Japan, and Brazil are the three biggest countries using the app.\n\nSource: Similarweb, Bluesky1\n\n## Misc. Bluesky statistics\n\nBefore we wrap up, here are a few more stats about Bluesky that you might find interesting.\n\n### 25. Bluesky currently only has around 20 full-time employees\n\nThat works out at around a million users per employee, but Bluesky has said that they’re hiring, so expect this number to shoot up soon.\n\nSource: Bluesky3\n\n### 26. Bluesky has raised $23 million in funding\n\nThat includes a more recent $15 million series A funding round and an $8 million seed round in 2023.\n\nSource: TechCrunch\n\n### 27. The first ever post on Bluesky was from Paul Frazee (@pfrazee.com)\n\nThe inaugural post on Bluesky was made by developer Paul Frazee on November 16, 2022. Staying true to internet tradition, it was a simple yet iconic declaration: ‘First!’\n\nSource: Bluesky4\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nAs these stats show, Bluesky is currently one of the fastest-growing social media apps.\n\nIt’s successfully capitalized on the controversy surrounding X and is siphoning its users at an alarming rate.\n\nWhether or not it will maintain its current growth rate remains to be seen. But if it does, it could spell disaster for competitors X and Threads.\n\nVery few [social media schedulers](https://adamconnell.me/social-media-scheduler-tools/) support the platform which is likely an issue for some. That said, you can schedule to Bluesky with [SocialBee](https://adamconnell.me/go/socialbee/) (aff).\n\nHungry for more stats?

The\nsitename: Proxidize\ndate: 2025-01-30\n---\nThe Bluesky user count has soared to over 25 million users as of December 2024, reflecting a remarkable surge from 13 million just two months earlier. The platform is currently growing at a rate of 5.4 users per second and is attracting approximately 466,500 new users daily.\n\nThis influx underscores Bluesky’s rapid expansion, especially among younger audiences where 42% of the user base is between 18-24. Brazil alone accounts for 37.7% of traffic, with the United States following at 25.6%.\n\nIn this article, we’ll examine Bluesky’s explosive growth, explore its user demographics, and discuss the key statistics that illustrate its emergence as a formidable social media platform.\n\n**What Is Bluesky?**\n\nBluesky takes a novel approach to social networking by functioning as a decentralized platform built on the AT Protocol. The project is open-source, giving anyone transparent insight into its design. Users can share 300-character text messages, images, and videos, all while controlling the nature of their feeds.\n\nBut how exactly does Bluesky differentiate itself? One answer is its “marketplace of algorithms” that lets users choose or create custom feeds based on preferences. With over 50k custom feeds available, Bluesky offers a unique degree of flexibility in shaping one’s experience. The platform also includes user-managed moderation and labeling services, plus user-made “starter packs” that help newcomers jump in with relevant communities.\n\nIn terms of corporate identity, Bluesky operates as a Public Benefit Corporation, with ownership primarily held by CEO Jay Graber and the Bluesky team. They are supported by a board that features notable innovators like Jeremie Miller (inventor of Jabber/XMPP), Mike Masnick, and Kinjal Shah. This structure preserves the platform’s focus on growing and promoting open-source technology for decentralized public conversation.\n\nBluesky’s handle system is another hallmark. Instead of relying on standard “checkmarks,” the platform uses domain name-based handles that require users to prove domain ownership. This approach aims to preserve authenticity and give creators independence in self-identification.\n\n**Who Owns Bluesky?**\n\nOriginally a Twitter-side project in 2019, Bluesky spun off in 2021 as an independent company and Public Benefit Corporation. Today, CEO Jay Graber — previously behind the event-coordination platform “Happening” — owns much of Bluesky, while the rest is distributed among the internal team.\n\nThe board includes:\n\n**Jeremie Miller**: Renowned for inventing Jabber/XMPP.**Mike Masnick**: Founder of TechDirt and the Copia Institute think tank.**Kinjal Shah**: General partner at Blockchain Capital.\n\nFormer Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who started the Bluesky initiative, left the board in May 2024. Post-departure, Dorsey directed a significant $5 million investment to Nostr, another decentralized platform. Meanwhile, Bluesky secured $5 million in funding — led by Blockchain Capital — in October 2024. So far, the company has raised $36 million in total, opting against traditional advertising and exploring subscription models instead.\n\n**Explosive User Growth in 2024-2025**\n\nSeptember 2024 was pivotal for Bluesky: the platform went from 9 million users to 20 million by November, marking a jaw-dropping 189% growth rate that month — plus a 284% spike in daily active users.\n\nAlthough growth slowed a bit in December, there was still a solid 9.6% increase in US website visits, easily outpacing competitor Threads, which slipped by 1.6%. Globally, Bluesky’s momentum in December 2024 looked like this:\n\n**Monthly Growth**\n\nPlatform | Oct 2024 | Nov 2024 | Dec 2024 |\n| Bluesky | 11.23% | 75.15% | 9.5% |\n| Threads | 9.05% | 8.13% | 5.7% |\n| X | 6.93% | -2.27% | 2.4% |\n\n[Proxidize](https://proxidize.com/blog/bluesky-user-count-2025/)\n\nNotably, the presidential election news in November 2024 acted as a huge catalyst, leading Bluesky to dominate the US App Store rankings for more than a week. High-profile users — including celebrities, journalists, and creators — flocked to the platform, driving up engagement by as much as tenfold for some organizations.\n\nBy the end of 2024, Bluesky’s worldwide growth had shot up by 930% year-over-year, while its two-year growth topped 30,564%. That performance solidified Bluesky’s status as a serious contender in the [social media](https://proxidize.com/blog/social-media-management/) network space.\n\n**Key Growth Catalysts and Milestones**\n\n**US Presidential Election Impact**\n\nThe US presidential election in November 2024 set off a surge of 13 million new users in just six weeks. During the window of November 6-15, daily website visits in the US ballooned by 519%, compared to average traffic for the first ten months of 2024.\n\nInteractions also skyrocketed, with some organizations reporting a 2x to 10x jump in engagement. Unsurprisingly, the platform processed a record-breaking 6.5 million content violation reports — a 17-fold leap from the previous year.\n\n**Brazil Market Expansion**\n\nA temporary ban of X in Brazil led to Bluesky registering 2.6 million new users in a single week. Of those, a staggering 85% were from Brazil, fundamentally [reshaping the platform’s user demographics](https://proxidize.com/blog/geolocation-testing/):\n\nRegion | Traffic Share |\n| Brazil | 37.7% |\n| United States | 25.6% |\n| Other Markets | 36.7% |\n\n[Proxidize](https://proxidize.com/blog/bluesky-user-count-2025/)\n\nThis sudden growth led to a backlog in user-managed moderation and labelling services, prompting Bluesky to scale its Portuguese-language moderation team and automate riskier areas. Simultaneously, an engineering team of 20 full-time employees (sometimes noted as 20 full-time employees) introduced new tools such as video sharing and trending topics to accommodate the larger audience.\n\n**Bluesky Statistics**\n\nRecent [demographic data](https://proxidize.com/use-cases/market-research/) offers a deep dive into Bluesky’s usage statistics. Notably, male users make up about 69.63% of the audience, while female users account for roughly 30.37%.\n\n**Age and Gender Distribution**\n\nThe average user on Bluesky skews young, with 42% in the 18-24 bracket:\n\nAge Group | Percentage |\n| 18-24 | 42.0% |\n| 25-34 | 27.5% |\n| 35-44 | 13.3% |\n| 45-54 | 7.7% |\n| 55-64 | 5.6% |\n| 65+ | 3.8% |\n\n[Proxidize](https://proxidize.com/blog/bluesky-user-count-2025/)\n\nAltogether, 70% of active users are under 34, reflecting a strong foothold among younger demographics. Engagement metrics are equally robust: the average visit durations are 9 minutes 46 seconds, with 1.51 pages viewed per session.\n\nIn terms of traffic sources, direct access accounts for 44.1% of visits, referrals generate 29.06%, organic search pulls 21.26%, and social media funnels 4.79%.\n\nMeanwhile, the platform’s lean workforce — about 20 full-time employees and 100 contractors — has managed to support the rising exodus of users from rival platforms while keeping moderation operations stable.\n\n**Website Traffic Analysis**\n\nIn December 2024, Bluesky recorded 154.68 million monthly website visits — up 93% from October. The table below illustrates the platform’s top traffic sources:\n\n**Direct**: 44.1%**Referral**: 29.06%**Organic Search**: 21.26%**Social Media**: 4.79%\n\n**App Download Statistics**\n\nMonthly app downloads remained consistently high in 2024:\n\nMonth (2024) | Downloads |\n| September | 2.85M |\n| October | 2.76M |\n| November | 7.85M |\n| December | 1.76M |\n\n[Proxidize](https://proxidize.com/blog/bluesky-user-count-2025/)\n\nClearly, November was a surge in usage, coinciding with a broader exodus of users from competing services.\n\n**User Engagement Rates**\n\nUsage statistics also underscore Bluesky’s impressive engagement. On average, visitors spend around 9 minutes and 46 seconds per session. Overall figures include:\n\n**Total posts**: 973.80 million**Total follows**: 1.982 billion**Total likes**: 4.698 billion\n\nPublishers see some of the biggest gains, often experiencing 3-4x more clicks and conversions than on rival platforms. For instance, The Boston Globe logged a 4.5x increase in conversions to paid subscriptions via Bluesky compared to other social media service sites.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nFrom 9 million to 25 million users in just a few months, Bluesky’s meteoric rise speaks for itself. The platform’s decentralization, block feature, and algorithmic choice have proven especially appealing to users looking for a social platform that puts them in control.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n**Young, Global Demographic**: 42% of users are 18-24, with Brazil at 37.7% of traffic and the US at 25.6%.**Decentralized Platform**: Built on the AT Protocol, offering over 50k custom feeds and user-managed moderation.**Explosive Growth**: Jumped from 9M to 20M users in two months, peaking with a 189% monthly growth rate and 930% year-over-year increase.**Election & Brazil Ban Boost**: US presidential election added 13M users in six weeks; X’s ban in Brazil brought 2.6M users in one week.**High Engagement**: Average session lasts 9 minutes 46 seconds; total posts at 973.80M, total follows at 1.982B, total likes at 4.698B.**Bright Outlook**: Annual growth of 930% and two-year growth of 30,564% underscore Bluesky’s appeal as a fast-scaling social media platform.\n\nThe cross-border appeal — spanning from the US to Brazil — backs up its ambition to become more than just another social network. Average session lengths nearing 10 minutes and triple-digit traffic growth show that this social media app is managing to sustain engagement, even with a relatively small employee base.\n\nPerhaps most notably, Bluesky’s annual growth of 930% and two-year growth hitting 30,564% confirm its ability to scale and keep pace with user demand. As daily users continue to climb, the platform’s future looks bright, thanks to its decentralized platform model, user-focused features, and an ever-expanding user base that craves genuine engagement.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n**Is Bluesky growing?**\n\nAs of December 2024, Bluesky has surpassed 25 million users and has grown by around 466,500 new users daily.

In this post, I’ll share 27 Bluesky statistics you need to know, covering users, demographics, and more….\nsitename: Adam Connell\ndate: 2025-01-16\n---\n# Bluesky Statistics For 2025 (Users, Demographics, Growth)\n\nLooking for the latest Bluesky statistics? You’re in the right place.\n\nBluesky is the app everyone’s talking about right now.\n\nFollowing a recent surge in user numbers, it’s become one of the fastest-growing social media platforms. This has led many to wonder if Bluesky will finally emerge as a serious competitor to rival platform X (formerly Twitter).\n\nIn this post, I’ll be sharing 27 stats that reveal more about Bluesky’s meteoric growth, its user demographics, and other interesting insights.\n\n## Top picks\n\n- Bluesky has 23.2 million total users and 3.2 million daily active users (Theo.io, Similarweb3)\n- Users visit the Bluesky website 75.8 million times monthly… (Similarweb)\n- …and download the Bluesky app 400k times daily (Appfigures)\n- Bluesky users have shared over 658 million posts in total (bsky.jazco.dev)\n- Bluesky users have followed accounts 1.1 billion times and liked posts 1.1 billion times (bsky.jazco.dev)\n- Bluesky (@bsky.app) is the most-followed account on the platform (VQV.APP)\n- Most Bluesky users are from Brazil (37.7%), the US (25.6%), and Japan (8.7%) (Similarweb, Bluesky1)\n\n## Bluesky user statistics\n\nFirst, let’s look at statistics that highlight how many people currently use Bluesky, how those numbers have changed over time, and the factors that are driving its growth.\n\n### 1. Bluesky has over 23.2 million total registered users…\n\nAt the time of writing, around 23.2 million people have signed up for Bluesky—and that figure is changing rapidly. By the time you read this post, it may be significantly higher.\n\nBluesky still has a long way to go to catch up to rival platform X, which is the 11th [most-used social media platform](https://adamconnell.me/social-media-platforms/) with 619 million users. However, if Bluesky maintains its current momentum, it may begin to close that gap over the next few years.\n\nSource: Theo.io\n\n### 2. …that’s up from just 1 million users last year…\n\nSince raising their seed round in 2023, Bluesky has gone from an invite-only app with a modest 1 million users to an open app with more than 23.2 million users from all over the world…and counting!\n\nWhat’s more, most of those new users signed up in just the last few months alone. Bluesky had just 5 million users as of March 2024. And an incredible 2.6 million new users registered within just a few days at the start of September 2024.\n\nSource: Bluesky6\n\n### 3. …and is increasing by 5.4 users per second\n\nAccording to theo.io’s user counter, 5.4 users are registering for Bluesky every second (at the time of writing). That works out to 324 new users a minute, 19,440 new users an hour, and roughly 466.5k new users a day.\n\nThe rate at which new users sign up for the platform is constantly changing—and it’s been even faster in the past. At one point in November this year, Bluesky was adding roughly a million new users a day.\n\nSource: Theo.io, Bluesky5\n\n### 4. Bluesky has around 3.2 million daily active users (DAUs) in the US\n\nAs of mid-November 2024, around 3.2 million people in the US use Bluesky daily. That number has ticked up dramatically over the last month.\n\nSite: Similarweb3\n\n### 5. Bluesky usage in the US is up 500% since election day\n\nThe US election served as a catalyst for the ongoing exodus of users from Bluesky’s rival social media app, X.\n\nMany liberal users expressed concerns about misinformation on the platform, as well as concerns that X was used as a vehicle to help with the Republican’s election campaign due to owner Elon Musk’s political leanings and close ties to the Trump administration.\n\nAs a result, liberal users have been leaving X in droves—and many of them have found their way to Bluesky, which has caused this recent surge in usage. Aside from the US, Bluesky usage is also up 350% in the UK since the US election.\n\nSite: Similarweb3\n\n### 6. Bluesky gained 3 million new users the week after X was suspended in Brazil…\n\nEarlier this year, Brazil’s Supreme Court suspended X. As a result, Brazilians who could no longer access X signed up for Bluesky instead, which led to one of the biggest leaps in user numbers Bluesky has seen to date.\n\nSource: Bluesky7\n\n### 7. …and 1.2 million new users in the days following the announcement that X would change the ‘block’ feature\n\nEarlier this year, X made the controversial decision to change its block feature so that users could still see content from accounts they’d blocked—a change that was widely criticized.\n\nAgain, Bluesky was well-positioned to capitalize on this as 1.2 million disgruntled users who left X as a result of the change signed up for Bluesky instead.\n\nSource: Bluesky8\n\n### 8. There are over 671 million posts on Bluesky\n\n…and counting! Users create tens of thousands of posts every day, so by the time you’re reading this, there are probably already millions more.\n\nSource: bsky.jazco.dev\n\n### 9. There are around 1.3 million daily unique posters on Bluesky\n\nThis varies every day, but it’s somewhere around that ballpark at the time of writing (November 2024).\n\nNotably, that’s significantly higher than last month, when there were just 293k unique daily posters.\n\nSource: bsky.jazco.dev\n\n## Bluesky engagement statistics\n\nNext, let’s look at some more Bluesky statistics about how users engage with content and accounts on the platform.\n\n### 10. There are over 1.1 billion total followers across all Bluesky accounts…\n\nThat’s the number you get if you add up the followers of every user on Bluesky.\n\nSource: bsky.jazco.dev\n\n### 11. …and over 2.9 billion total likes\n\nUsers on Bluesky have liked a combined total of 2.9 billion posts so far… and counting!\n\nSource: bsky.jazco.dev\n\n### 12. 50% of Bluesky users only have 1 follower\n\nAs Bluesky is still in its infancy, few users on the platform have managed to gain a significant number of followers (yet). Around half of all Bluesky users only have a single follower, and only the top 0.01% have accrued over 10k followers.\n\nPercentage of accounts | Number of followers |\n| 50% | 1+ |\n| 25% | 6+ |\n| 10% | 34+ |\n| 5% | 85+ |\n| 1% | 400+ |\n| 0.1% | 2,238+ |\n| 0.01% | 11,241+ |\n\n*Related: **How To Grow Your Social Media Following The Right Way*\n\nSource: bsky.jazco.dev\n\n### 13. The most followed account on Bluesky is… Bluesky!\n\nWhen you sign up for Bluesky, you automatically follow Bluesky (@bsky.app) by default. So unsurprisingly, Bluesky is the most-followed account on the platform with 15.9 million followers.\n\nThe table below shows the rest of the top-5 most-followed accounts on the platform at the time of writing.\n\nTop 5 most-followed Bluesky accounts | Number of followers |\n| Bluesky (@bsky.app) | 15.9 million |\n| Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@aoc.bsky.social) | 914,000 |\n| George Takei (@georgetakei.bsky.social) | 797,000 |\n| The New York Times (@nytimes.com) | 725,000 |\n| The Onion (@theonion.com) | 704,000 |\n\nSource: VQV.APP\n\n### 14. The most-liked post on Bluesky has 242.3k likes\n\nAccording to Bluesky’s feed of most popular posts on platforms by likes, the most-liked post is from Bluesky themselves (@bsky.app), in which they celebrate reaching a million new users.\n\nThe second most-liked post is another celebratory post from Bluesky (222.3k likes), and the third is from Mark Hamill (@markhamillofficial.bsky.social) with a joke about quitting Twitter (170.1k likes).\n\nSource: Bluesky2\n\n### 15. There are over 50,000 custom feeds on Bluesky\n\nOne of the things that differentiates Bluesky from competitors like X is that it offers ‘algorithmic choice’ by letting users create their own custom feeds to determine what content they see.\n\nAlternatively, they can deploy custom feeds that other users have created from the open marketplace. Over 50k custom feeds have been built so far.\n\n## Bluesky traffic & app downloads\n\nBelow you’ll find traffic statistics from Similarweb that reveal insights about Bluesky’s website visitors.\n\n### 16. People visited the Bluesky website over 75.8 million times last month\n\nAccording to Similarweb’s traffic data, the Bluesky website (bsky.app) had around 75.8 million total website visits. Note that this doesn’t mean Bluesky had over 75.8 million *unique *visitors—many of those visits will be repeat visits from the same users.\n\nSource: Similarweb\n\n### 17. The average visit duration for Bluesky is 9 minutes, 46 seconds\n\nThis should be a fairly good indication of the typical Bluesky session duration, i.e. how long the average user stays on Bluesky when they open the app/website.\n\nSource: Similarweb\n\n### 18. Bluesky is downloaded around 400k times a day\n\nAt the time of writing, Bluesky is downloaded around 400k times per day, on average. It overtook X (which has 250k daily downloads, on average) for the first time this month (November 2024).\n\nSource: Appfigures\n\n### 19. Bluesky was downloaded 3.2 million times last month\n\nUsers downloaded Bluesky around 3.2 million times in October 2024. That figure was even higher in September at 5.1 million.\n\nSource: Similarweb2\n\n### 20. Bluesky was downloaded over 9 million times in the second half of 2024\n\nAnd we’re not even at the end of the year yet, so expect that figure to increase. In comparison, Bluesky was downloaded only 1.4 million times in the first half of 2024.\n\nSource: Business of Apps\n\n### 21. Bluesky recently became the #1 top-performing app in the App Store\n\nIn November 2024, Bluesky became the #1 app in Apple’s App Store charts, with rival Threads in the #2 spot. The App Store charts rank apps based on download and revenue velocity, which suggests Bluesky is one of the fastest-growing apps this month.\n\nSource: Forbes, Apple\n\n## Bluesky demographics\n\nWhat demographics make up Bluesky’s user base? Let’s look at some more Bluesky statistics to find out.\n\n### 22. 64% of Bluesky users are male\n\nAlmost two-thirds of those who visit Bluesky are male (64%), while only a little over one-third are female (36%). This is based on traffic data from Similarweb as Bluesky hasn’t publicly shared its own internal data about user demographics.\n\nSource: Similarweb\n\n### 23. 42% of Bluesky users are 18 to 24 years old\n\nIt seems that Bluesky primarily appeals to younger users. According to Similarweb’s traffic data, around 42% of visitors to the site are between the ages of 18 to 24.\n\nAge | % of Bluesky website traffic |\n| 18-24 | 42% |\n| 25-34 | 27.5% |\n| 35-44 | 13.3% |\n| 45-54 | 7.7% |\n| 55-64 | 5.6% |\n| 65+ | 3.8% |\n\nSource: Similarweb\n\n### 24. 37.7% of Bluesky’s traffic comes from Brazil\n\nAccording to Similarweb, Brazil accounts for a greater portion of Bluesky’s website traffic than any other country. It’s followed by the US (25.6%), Japan (8.7%), and the UK (3.8%).\n\nBluesky’s Jay (@jay.bsky.team) also confirmed in a recent post that the US, Japan, and Brazil are the three biggest countries using the app.\n\nSource: Similarweb, Bluesky1\n\n## Misc. Bluesky statistics\n\nBefore we wrap up, here are a few more stats about Bluesky that you might find interesting.\n\n### 25. Bluesky currently only has around 20 full-time employees\n\nThat works out at around a million users per employee, but Bluesky has said that they’re hiring, so expect this number to shoot up soon.\n\nSource: Bluesky3\n\n### 26. Bluesky has raised $23 million in funding\n\nThat includes a more recent $15 million series A funding round and an $8 million seed round in 2023.\n\nSource: TechCrunch\n\n### 27. The first ever post on Bluesky was from Paul Frazee (@pfrazee.com)\n\nThe inaugural post on Bluesky was made by developer Paul Frazee on November 16, 2022. Staying true to internet tradition, it was a simple yet iconic declaration: ‘First!’\n\nSource: Bluesky4\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nAs these stats show, Bluesky is currently one of the fastest-growing social media apps.\n\nIt’s successfully capitalized on the controversy surrounding X and is siphoning its users at an alarming rate.\n\nWhether or not it will maintain its current growth rate remains to be seen. But if it does, it could spell disaster for competitors X and Threads.\n\nVery few [social media schedulers](https://adamconnell.me/social-media-scheduler-tools/) support the platform which is likely an issue for some. That said, you can schedule to Bluesky with [SocialBee](https://adamconnell.me/go/socialbee/) (aff).\n\nHungry for more stats?

The\nsitename: Proxidize\ndate: 2025-01-30\n---\nThe Bluesky user count has soared to over 25 million users as of December 2024, reflecting a remarkable surge from 13 million just two months earlier. The platform is currently growing at a rate of 5.4 users per second and is attracting approximately 466,500 new users daily.\n\nThis influx underscores Bluesky’s rapid expansion, especially among younger audiences where 42% of the user base is between 18-24. Brazil alone accounts for 37.7% of traffic, with the United States following at 25.6%.\n\nIn this article, we’ll examine Bluesky’s explosive growth, explore its user demographics, and discuss the key statistics that illustrate its emergence as a formidable social media platform.\n\n**What Is Bluesky?**\n\nBluesky takes a novel approach to social networking by functioning as a decentralized platform built on the AT Protocol. The project is open-source, giving anyone transparent insight into its design. Users can share 300-character text messages, images, and videos, all while controlling the nature of their feeds.\n\nBut how exactly does Bluesky differentiate itself? One answer is its “marketplace of algorithms” that lets users choose or create custom feeds based on preferences. With over 50k custom feeds available, Bluesky offers a unique degree of flexibility in shaping one’s experience. The platform also includes user-managed moderation and labeling services, plus user-made “starter packs” that help newcomers jump in with relevant communities.\n\nIn terms of corporate identity, Bluesky operates as a Public Benefit Corporation, with ownership primarily held by CEO Jay Graber and the Bluesky team. They are supported by a board that features notable innovators like Jeremie Miller (inventor of Jabber/XMPP), Mike Masnick, and Kinjal Shah. This structure preserves the platform’s focus on growing and promoting open-source technology for decentralized public conversation.\n\nBluesky’s handle system is another hallmark. Instead of relying on standard “checkmarks,” the platform uses domain name-based handles that require users to prove domain ownership. This approach aims to preserve authenticity and give creators independence in self-identification.\n\n**Who Owns Bluesky?**\n\nOriginally a Twitter-side project in 2019, Bluesky spun off in 2021 as an independent company and Public Benefit Corporation. Today, CEO Jay Graber — previously behind the event-coordination platform “Happening” — owns much of Bluesky, while the rest is distributed among the internal team.\n\nThe board includes:\n\n**Jeremie Miller**: Renowned for inventing Jabber/XMPP.**Mike Masnick**: Founder of TechDirt and the Copia Institute think tank.**Kinjal Shah**: General partner at Blockchain Capital.\n\nFormer Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who started the Bluesky initiative, left the board in May 2024. Post-departure, Dorsey directed a significant $5 million investment to Nostr, another decentralized platform. Meanwhile, Bluesky secured $5 million in funding — led by Blockchain Capital — in October 2024. So far, the company has raised $36 million in total, opting against traditional advertising and exploring subscription models instead.\n\n**Explosive User Growth in 2024-2025**\n\nSeptember 2024 was pivotal for Bluesky: the platform went from 9 million users to 20 million by November, marking a jaw-dropping 189% growth rate that month — plus a 284% spike in daily active users.\n\nAlthough growth slowed a bit in December, there was still a solid 9.6% increase in US website visits, easily outpacing competitor Threads, which slipped by 1.6%. Globally, Bluesky’s momentum in December 2024 looked like this:\n\n**Monthly Growth**\n\nPlatform | Oct 2024 | Nov 2024 | Dec 2024 |\n| Bluesky | 11.23% | 75.15% | 9.5% |\n| Threads | 9.05% | 8.13% | 5.7% |\n| X | 6.93% | -2.27% | 2.4% |\n\n[Proxidize](https://proxidize.com/blog/bluesky-user-count-2025/)\n\nNotably, the presidential election news in November 2024 acted as a huge catalyst, leading Bluesky to dominate the US App Store rankings for more than a week. High-profile users — including celebrities, journalists, and creators — flocked to the platform, driving up engagement by as much as tenfold for some organizations.\n\nBy the end of 2024, Bluesky’s worldwide growth had shot up by 930% year-over-year, while its two-year growth topped 30,564%. That performance solidified Bluesky’s status as a serious contender in the [social media](https://proxidize.com/blog/social-media-management/) network space.\n\n**Key Growth Catalysts and Milestones**\n\n**US Presidential Election Impact**\n\nThe US presidential election in November 2024 set off a surge of 13 million new users in just six weeks. During the window of November 6-15, daily website visits in the US ballooned by 519%, compared to average traffic for the first ten months of 2024.\n\nInteractions also skyrocketed, with some organizations reporting a 2x to 10x jump in engagement. Unsurprisingly, the platform processed a record-breaking 6.5 million content violation reports — a 17-fold leap from the previous year.\n\n**Brazil Market Expansion**\n\nA temporary ban of X in Brazil led to Bluesky registering 2.6 million new users in a single week. Of those, a staggering 85% were from Brazil, fundamentally [reshaping the platform’s user demographics](https://proxidize.com/blog/geolocation-testing/):\n\nRegion | Traffic Share |\n| Brazil | 37.7% |\n| United States | 25.6% |\n| Other Markets | 36.7% |\n\n[Proxidize](https://proxidize.com/blog/bluesky-user-count-2025/)\n\nThis sudden growth led to a backlog in user-managed moderation and labelling services, prompting Bluesky to scale its Portuguese-language moderation team and automate riskier areas. Simultaneously, an engineering team of 20 full-time employees (sometimes noted as 20 full-time employees) introduced new tools such as video sharing and trending topics to accommodate the larger audience.\n\n**Bluesky Statistics**\n\nRecent [demographic data](https://proxidize.com/use-cases/market-research/) offers a deep dive into Bluesky’s usage statistics. Notably, male users make up about 69.63% of the audience, while female users account for roughly 30.37%.\n\n**Age and Gender Distribution**\n\nThe average user on Bluesky skews young, with 42% in the 18-24 bracket:\n\nAge Group | Percentage |\n| 18-24 | 42.0% |\n| 25-34 | 27.5% |\n| 35-44 | 13.3% |\n| 45-54 | 7.7% |\n| 55-64 | 5.6% |\n| 65+ | 3.8% |\n\n[Proxidize](https://proxidize.com/blog/bluesky-user-count-2025/)\n\nAltogether, 70% of active users are under 34, reflecting a strong foothold among younger demographics. Engagement metrics are equally robust: the average visit durations are 9 minutes 46 seconds, with 1.51 pages viewed per session.\n\nIn terms of traffic sources, direct access accounts for 44.1% of visits, referrals generate 29.06%, organic search pulls 21.26%, and social media funnels 4.79%.\n\nMeanwhile, the platform’s lean workforce — about 20 full-time employees and 100 contractors — has managed to support the rising exodus of users from rival platforms while keeping moderation operations stable.\n\n**Website Traffic Analysis**\n\nIn December 2024, Bluesky recorded 154.68 million monthly website visits — up 93% from October. The table below illustrates the platform’s top traffic sources:\n\n**Direct**: 44.1%**Referral**: 29.06%**Organic Search**: 21.26%**Social Media**: 4.79%\n\n**App Download Statistics**\n\nMonthly app downloads remained consistently high in 2024:\n\nMonth (2024) | Downloads |\n| September | 2.85M |\n| October | 2.76M |\n| November | 7.85M |\n| December | 1.76M |\n\n[Proxidize](https://proxidize.com/blog/bluesky-user-count-2025/)\n\nClearly, November was a surge in usage, coinciding with a broader exodus of users from competing services.\n\n**User Engagement Rates**\n\nUsage statistics also underscore Bluesky’s impressive engagement. On average, visitors spend around 9 minutes and 46 seconds per session. Overall figures include:\n\n**Total posts**: 973.80 million**Total follows**: 1.982 billion**Total likes**: 4.698 billion\n\nPublishers see some of the biggest gains, often experiencing 3-4x more clicks and conversions than on rival platforms. For instance, The Boston Globe logged a 4.5x increase in conversions to paid subscriptions via Bluesky compared to other social media service sites.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nFrom 9 million to 25 million users in just a few months, Bluesky’s meteoric rise speaks for itself. The platform’s decentralization, block feature, and algorithmic choice have proven especially appealing to users looking for a social platform that puts them in control.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n**Young, Global Demographic**: 42% of users are 18-24, with Brazil at 37.7% of traffic and the US at 25.6%.**Decentralized Platform**: Built on the AT Protocol, offering over 50k custom feeds and user-managed moderation.**Explosive Growth**: Jumped from 9M to 20M users in two months, peaking with a 189% monthly growth rate and 930% year-over-year increase.**Election & Brazil Ban Boost**: US presidential election added 13M users in six weeks; X’s ban in Brazil brought 2.6M users in one week.**High Engagement**: Average session lasts 9 minutes 46 seconds; total posts at 973.80M, total follows at 1.982B, total likes at 4.698B.**Bright Outlook**: Annual growth of 930% and two-year growth of 30,564% underscore Bluesky’s appeal as a fast-scaling social media platform.\n\nThe cross-border appeal — spanning from the US to Brazil — backs up its ambition to become more than just another social network. Average session lengths nearing 10 minutes and triple-digit traffic growth show that this social media app is managing to sustain engagement, even with a relatively small employee base.\n\nPerhaps most notably, Bluesky’s annual growth of 930% and two-year growth hitting 30,564% confirm its ability to scale and keep pace with user demand. As daily users continue to climb, the platform’s future looks bright, thanks to its decentralized platform model, user-focused features, and an ever-expanding user base that craves genuine engagement.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n**Is Bluesky growing?**\n\nAs of December 2024, Bluesky has surpassed 25 million users and has grown by around 466,500 new users daily.

However, if Bluesky maintains its current momentum, it may begin to close that gap over the next few years.\\n\\nSource: Theo.io\\n\\n### 2. \\u2026that\\u2019s up from just 1 million users last year\\u2026\\n\\nSince raising their seed round in 2023, Bluesky has gone from an invite-only app with a modest 1 million users to an open app with more than 23.2 million users from all over the world\\u2026and counting!\\n\\nWhat\\u2019s more, most of those new users signed up in just the last few months alone. Bluesky had just 5 million users as of March 2024. And an incredible 2.6 million new users registered within just a few days at the start of September 2024.\\n\\nSource: Bluesky6\\n\\n### 3. \\u2026and is increasing by 5.4 users per second\\n\\nAccording to theo.io\\u2019s user counter, 5.4 users are registering for Bluesky every second (at the time of writing). That works out to 324 new users a minute, 19,440 new users an hour, and roughly 466.5k new users a day.\\n\\nThe rate at which new users sign up for the platform is constantly changing\\u2014and it\\u2019s been even faster in the past. At one point in November this year, Bluesky was adding roughly a million new users a day.\\n\\nSource: Theo.io, Bluesky5\\n\\n### 4. Bluesky has around 3.2 million daily active users (DAUs) in the US\\n\\nAs of mid-November 2024, around 3.2 million people in the US use Bluesky daily. That number has ticked up dramatically over the last month.\\n\\nSite: Similarweb3\\n\\n### 5. Bluesky usage in the US is up 500% since election day\\n\\nThe US election served as a catalyst for the ongoing exodus of users from Bluesky\\u2019s rival social media app, X.\\n\\nMany liberal users expressed concerns about misinformation on the platform, as well as concerns that X was used as a vehicle to help with the Republican\\u2019s election campaign due to owner Elon Musk\\u2019s political leanings and close ties to the Trump administration.\\n\\nAs a result, liberal users have been leaving X in droves\\u2014and many of them have found their way to Bluesky, which has caused this recent surge in usage. Aside from the US, Bluesky usage is also up 350% in the UK since the US election.\\n\\nSite: Similarweb3\\n\\n### 6. Bluesky gained 3 million new users the week after X was suspended in Brazil\\u2026\\n\\nEarlier this year, Brazil\\u2019s Supreme Court suspended X.

The\\nsitename: Proxidize\\ndate: 2025-01-30\\n---\\nThe Bluesky user count has soared to over 25 million users as of December 2024, reflecting a remarkable surge from 13 million just two months earlier. The platform is currently growing at a rate of 5.4 users per second and is attracting approximately 466,500 new users daily.\\n\\nThis influx underscores Bluesky\\u2019s rapid expansion, especially among younger audiences where 42% of the user base is between 18-24. Brazil alone accounts for 37.7% of traffic, with the United States following at 25.6%.\\n\\nIn this article, we\\u2019ll examine Bluesky\\u2019s explosive growth, explore its user demographics, and discuss the key statistics that illustrate its emergence as a formidable social media platform.\\n\\n**What Is Bluesky?**\\n\\nBluesky takes a novel approach to social networking by functioning as a decentralized platform built on the AT Protocol. The project is open-source, giving anyone transparent insight into its design. Users can share 300-character text messages, images, and videos, all while controlling the nature of their feeds.\\n\\nBut how exactly does Bluesky differentiate itself? One answer is its \\u201cmarketplace of algorithms\\u201d that lets users choose or create custom feeds based on preferences. With over 50k custom feeds available, Bluesky offers a unique degree of flexibility in shaping one\\u2019s experience. The platform also includes user-managed moderation and labeling services, plus user-made \\u201cstarter packs\\u201d that help newcomers jump in with relevant communities.\\n\\nIn terms of corporate identity, Bluesky operates as a Public Benefit Corporation, with ownership primarily held by CEO Jay Graber and the Bluesky team. They are supported by a board that features notable innovators like Jeremie Miller (inventor of Jabber/XMPP), Mike Masnick, and Kinjal Shah. This structure preserves the platform\\u2019s focus on growing and promoting open-source technology for decentralized public conversation.\\n\\nBluesky\\u2019s handle system is another hallmark. Instead of relying on standard \\u201ccheckmarks,\\u201d the platform uses domain name-based handles that require users to prove domain ownership. This approach aims to preserve authenticity and give creators independence in self-identification.\\n\\n**Who Owns Bluesky?**\\n\\nOriginally a Twitter-side project in 2019, Bluesky spun off in 2021 as an independent company and Public Benefit Corporation. Today, CEO Jay Graber \\u2014 previously behind the event-coordination platform \\u201cHappening\\u201d \\u2014 owns much of Bluesky, while the rest is distributed among the internal team.\\n\\nThe board includes:\\n\\n**Jeremie Miller**: Renowned for inventing Jabber/XMPP.**Mike Masnick**: Founder of TechDirt and the Copia Institute think tank.**Kinjal Shah**: General partner at Blockchain Capital.\\n\\nFormer Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who started the Bluesky initiative, left the board in May 2024. Post-departure, Dorsey directed a significant $5 million investment to Nostr, another decentralized platform. Meanwhile, Bluesky secured $5 million in funding \\u2014 led by Blockchain Capital \\u2014 in October 2024. So far, the company has raised $36 million in total, opting against traditional advertising and exploring subscription models instead.\\n\\n**Explosive User Growth in 2024-2025**\\n\\nSeptember 2024 was pivotal for Bluesky: the platform went from 9 million users to 20 million by November, marking a jaw-dropping 189% growth rate that month \\u2014 plus a 284% spike in daily active users.\\n\\nAlthough growth slowed a bit in December, there was still a solid 9.6% increase in US website visits, easily outpacing competitor Threads, which slipped by 1.6%. Globally, Bluesky\\u2019s momentum in December 2024 looked like this:\\n\\n**Monthly Growth**\\n\\nPlatform | Oct 2024 | Nov 2024 | Dec 2024 |\\n| Bluesky | 11.23% | 75.15% | 9.5% |\\n| Threads | 9.05% | 8.13% | 5.7% |\\n| X | 6.93% | -2.27% | 2.4% |\\n\\n[Proxidize](https://proxidize.com/blog/bluesky-user-count-2025/)\\n\\nNotably, the presidential election news in November 2024 acted as a huge catalyst, leading Bluesky to dominate the US App Store rankings for more than a week. High-profile users \\u2014 including celebrities, journalists, and creators \\u2014 flocked to the platform, driving up engagement by as much as tenfold for some organizations.\\n\\nBy the end of 2024, Bluesky\\u2019s worldwide growth had shot up by 930% year-over-year, while its two-year growth topped 30,564%. That performance solidified Bluesky\\u2019s status as a serious contender in the [social media](https://proxidize.com/blog/social-media-management/) network space.\\n\\n**Key Growth Catalysts and Milestones**\\n\\n**US Presidential Election Impact**\\n\\nThe US presidential election in November 2024 set off a surge of 13 million new users in just six weeks. During the window of November 6-15, daily website visits in the US ballooned by 519%, compared to average traffic for the first ten months of 2024.\\n\\nInteractions also skyrocketed, with some organizations reporting a 2x to 10x jump in engagement. Unsurprisingly, the platform processed a record-breaking 6.5 million content violation reports \\u2014 a 17-fold leap from the previous year.\\n\\n**Brazil Market Expansion**\\n\\nA temporary ban of X in Brazil led to Bluesky registering 2.6 million new users in a single week. Of those, a staggering 85% were from Brazil, fundamentally [reshaping the platform\\u2019s user demographics](https://proxidize.com/blog/geolocation-testing/):\\n\\nRegion | Traffic Share |\\n| Brazil | 37.7% |\\n| United States | 25.6% |\\n| Other Markets | 36.7% |\\n\\n[Proxidize](https://proxidize.com/blog/bluesky-user-count-2025/)\\n\\nThis sudden growth led to a backlog in user-managed moderation and labelling services, prompting Bluesky to scale its Portuguese-language moderation team and automate riskier areas. Simultaneously, an engineering team of 20 full-time employees (sometimes noted as 20 full-time employees) introduced new tools such as video sharing and trending topics to accommodate the larger audience.\\n\\n**Bluesky Statistics**\\n\\nRecent [demographic data](https://proxidize.com/use-cases/market-research/) offers a deep dive into Bluesky\\u2019s usage statistics. Notably, male users make up about 69.63% of the audience, while female users account for roughly 30.37%.\\n\\n**Age and Gender Distribution**\\n\\nThe average user on Bluesky skews young, with 42% in the 18-24 bracket:\\n\\nAge Group | Percentage |\\n| 18-24 | 42.0% |\\n| 25-34 | 27.5% |\\n| 35-44 | 13.3% |\\n| 45-54 | 7.7% |\\n| 55-64 | 5.6% |\\n| 65+ | 3.8% |\\n\\n[Proxidize](https://proxidize.com/blog/bluesky-user-count-2025/)\\n\\nAltogether, 70% of active users are under 34, reflecting a strong foothold among younger demographics. Engagement metrics are equally robust: the average visit durations are 9 minutes 46 seconds, with 1.51 pages viewed per session.\\n\\nIn terms of traffic sources, direct access accounts for 44.1% of visits, referrals generate 29.06%, organic search pulls 21.26%, and social media funnels 4.79%.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the platform\\u2019s lean workforce \\u2014 about 20 full-time employees and 100 contractors \\u2014 has managed to support the rising exodus of users from rival platforms while keeping moderation operations stable.\\n\\n**Website Traffic Analysis**\\n\\nIn December 2024, Bluesky recorded 154.68 million monthly website visits \\u2014 up 93% from October. The table below illustrates the platform\\u2019s top traffic sources:\\n\\n**Direct**: 44.1%**Referral**: 29.06%**Organic Search**: 21.26%**Social Media**: 4.79%\\n\\n**App Download Statistics**\\n\\nMonthly app downloads remained consistently high in 2024:\\n\\nMonth (2024) | Downloads |\\n| September | 2.85M |\\n| October | 2.76M |\\n| November | 7.85M |\\n| December | 1.76M |\\n\\n[Proxidize](https://proxidize.com/blog/bluesky-user-count-2025/)\\n\\nClearly, November was a surge in usage, coinciding with a broader exodus of users from competing services.\\n\\n**User Engagement Rates**\\n\\nUsage statistics also underscore Bluesky\\u2019s impressive engagement. On average, visitors spend around 9 minutes and 46 seconds per session. Overall figures include:\\n\\n**Total posts**: 973.80 million**Total follows**: 1.982 billion**Total likes**: 4.698 billion\\n\\nPublishers see some of the biggest gains, often experiencing 3-4x more clicks and conversions than on rival platforms. For instance, The Boston Globe logged a 4.5x increase in conversions to paid subscriptions via Bluesky compared to other social media service sites.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nFrom 9 million to 25 million users in just a few months, Bluesky\\u2019s meteoric rise speaks for itself. The platform\\u2019s decentralization, block feature, and algorithmic choice have proven especially appealing to users looking for a social platform that puts them in control.\\n\\n**Key Takeaways:**\\n\\n**Young, Global Demographic**: 42% of users are 18-24, with Brazil at 37.7% of traffic and the US at 25.6%.**Decentralized Platform**: Built on the AT Protocol, offering over 50k custom feeds and user-managed moderation.**Explosive Growth**: Jumped from 9M to 20M users in two months, peaking with a 189% monthly growth rate and 930% year-over-year increase.**Election & Brazil Ban Boost**: US presidential election added 13M users in six weeks; X\\u2019s ban in Brazil brought 2.6M users in one week.**High Engagement**: Average session lasts 9 minutes 46 seconds; total posts at 973.80M, total follows at 1.982B, total likes at 4.698B.**Bright Outlook**: Annual growth of 930% and two-year growth of 30,564% underscore Bluesky\\u2019s appeal as a fast-scaling social media platform.\\n\\nThe cross-border appeal \\u2014 spanning from the US to Brazil \\u2014 backs up its ambition to become more than just another social network. Average session lengths nearing 10 minutes and triple-digit traffic growth show that this social media app is managing to sustain engagement, even with a relatively small employee base.\\n\\nPerhaps most notably, Bluesky\\u2019s annual growth of 930% and two-year growth hitting 30,564% confirm its ability to scale and keep pace with user demand. As daily users continue to climb, the platform\\u2019s future looks bright, thanks to its decentralized platform model, user-focused features, and an ever-expanding user base that craves genuine engagement.\\n\\n**Sources:**\\n\\n## Frequently Asked Questions\\n\\n**Is Bluesky growing?**\\n\\nAs of December 2024, Bluesky has surpassed 25 million users and has grown by around 466,500 new users daily.

In this post, I\\u0019ll share 27 Bluesky statistics you need to know, covering users, demographics, and more\\u0019.\\nsitename: Adam Connell\\ndate: 2025-01-16\\n---\\n# Bluesky Statistics For 2025 (Users, Demographics, Growth)\\n\\nLooking for the latest Bluesky statistics? You\\u0019re in the right place.\\n\\nBluesky is the app everyone\\u0019s talking about right now.\\n\\nFollowing a recent surge in user numbers, it\\u0019s become one of the fastest-growing social media platforms. This has led many to wonder if Bluesky will finally emerge as a serious competitor to rival platform X (formerly Twitter).\\n\\nIn this post, I\\u0019ll be sharing 27 stats that reveal more about Bluesky\\u0019s meteoric growth, its user demographics, and other interesting insights.\\n\\n## Top picks\\n\\n- Bluesky has 23.2 million total users and 3.2 million daily active users (Theo.io, Similarweb3)\\n- Users visit the Bluesky website 75.8 million times monthly\\u0019 (Similarweb)\\n- \\u0019and download the Bluesky app 400k times daily (Appfigures)\\n- Bluesky users have shared over 658 million posts in total (bsky.jazco.dev)\\n- Bluesky users have followed accounts 1.1 billion times and liked posts 1.1 billion times (bsky.jazco.dev)\\n- Bluesky (@bsky.app) is the most-followed account on the platform (VQV.APP)\\n- Most Bluesky users are from Brazil (37.7%), the US (25.6%), and Japan (8.7%) (Similarweb, Bluesky1)\\n\\n## Bluesky user statistics\\n\\nFirst, let\\u0019s look at statistics that highlight how many people currently use Bluesky, how those numbers have changed over time, and the factors that are driving its growth.\\n\\n### 1. Bluesky has over 23.2 million total registered users\\u0019\\n\\nAt the time of writing, around 23.2 million people have signed up for Bluesky\\u0014and that figure is changing rapidly. By the time you read this post, it may be significantly higher.\\n\\nBluesky still has a long way to go to catch up to rival platform X, which is the 11th [most-used social media platform](https://adamconnell.me/social-media-platforms/) with 619 million users. However, if Bluesky maintains its current momentum, it may begin to close that gap over the next few years.\\n\\nSource: Theo.io\\n\\n### 2. \\u0019that\\u0019s up from just 1 million users last year\\u0019\\n\\nSince raising their seed round in 2023, Bluesky has gone from an invite-only app with a modest 1 million users to an open app with more than 23.2 million users from all over the world\\u0014and counting!\\n\\nWhat\\u0019s more, most of those new users signed up in just the last few months alone. Bluesky had just 5 million users as of March 2024. And an incredible 2.6 million new users registered within just a few days at the start of September 2024.\\n\\nSource: Bluesky6\\n\\n### 3. \\u0019and is increasing by 5.4 users per second\\n\\nAccording to theo.io\\u0019s user counter, 5.4 users are registering for Bluesky every second (at the time of writing). That works out to 324 new users a minute, 19,440 new users an hour, and roughly 466.5k new users a day.\\n\\nThe rate at which new users sign up for the platform is constantly changing\\u0014and it\\u0019s been even faster in the past. At one point in November this year, Bluesky was adding roughly a million new users a day.\\n\\nSource: Theo.io, Bluesky5\\n\\n### 4. Bluesky has around 3.2 million daily active users (DAUs) in the US\\n\\nAs of mid-November 2024, around 3.2 million people in the US use Bluesky daily. That number has ticked up dramatically over the last month.\\n\\nSite: Similarweb3\\n\\n### 5. Bluesky usage in the US is up 500% since election day\\n\\nThe US election served as a catalyst for the ongoing exodus of users from Bluesky\\u0019s rival social media app, X.\\n\\nMany liberal users expressed concerns about misinformation on the platform, as well as concerns that X was used as a vehicle to help with the Republican\\u0019s election campaign due to owner Elon Musk\\u0019s political leanings and close ties to the Trump administration.\\n\\nAs a result, liberal users have been leaving X in droves\\u0014and many of them have found their way to Bluesky, which has caused this recent surge in usage. Aside from the US, Bluesky usage is also up 350% in the UK since the US election.\\n\\nSite: Similarweb3\\n\\n### 6. Bluesky gained 3 million new users the week after X was suspended in Brazil\\u0019\\n\\nEarlier this year, Brazil\\u0019s Supreme Court suspended X. As a result, Brazilians who could no longer access X signed up for Bluesky instead, which led to one of the biggest leaps in user numbers Bluesky has seen to date.\\n\\nSource: Bluesky7\\n\\n### 7. \\u0019and 1.2 million new users in the days following the announcement that X would change the \\u0018block\\u0019 feature\\n\\nEarlier this year, X made the controversial decision to change its block feature so that users could still see content from accounts they\\u0019d blocked\\u0014a change that was widely criticized.\\n\\nAgain, Bluesky was well-positioned to capitalize on this as 1.2 million disgruntled users who left X as a result of the change signed up for Bluesky instead.\\n\\nSource: Bluesky8\\n\\n### 8. There are over 671 million posts on Bluesky\\n\\n\\u0019and counting! Users create tens of thousands of posts every day, so by the time you\\u0019re reading this, there are probably already millions more.\\n\\nSource: bsky.jazco.dev\\n\\n### 9. There are around 1.3 million daily unique posters on Bluesky\\n\\nThis varies every day, but it\\u0019s somewhere around that ballpark at the time of writing (November 2024).\\n\\nNotably, that\\u0019s significantly higher than last month, when there were just 293k unique daily posters.\\n\\nSource: bsky.jazco.dev\\n\\n## Bluesky engagement statistics\\n\\nNext, let\\u0019s look at some more Bluesky statistics about how users engage with content and accounts on the platform.\\n\\n### 10. There are over 1.1 billion total followers across all Bluesky accounts\\u0019\\n\\nThat\\u0019s the number you get if you add up the followers of every user on Bluesky.\\n\\nSource: bsky.jazco.dev\\n\\n### 11. \\u0019and over 2.9 billion total likes\\n\\nUsers on Bluesky have liked a combined total of 2.9 billion posts so far\\u0019 and counting!\\n\\nSource: bsky.jazco.dev\\n\\n### 12. 50% of Bluesky users only have 1 follower\\n\\nAs Bluesky is still in its infancy, few users on the platform have managed to gain a significant number of followers (yet). Around half of all Bluesky users only have a single follower, and only the top 0.01% have accrued over 10k followers.\\n\\nPercentage of accounts | Number of followers |\\n| 50% | 1+ |\\n| 25% | 6+ |\\n| 10% | 34+ |\\n| 5% | 85+ |\\n| 1% | 400+ |\\n| 0.1% | 2,238+ |\\n| 0.01% | 11,241+ |\\n\\n*Related: **How To Grow Your Social Media Following The Right Way*\\n\\nSource: bsky.jazco.dev\\n\\n### 13. The most followed account on Bluesky is\\u0019 Bluesky!\\n\\nWhen you sign up for Bluesky, you automatically follow Bluesky (@bsky.app) by default. So unsurprisingly, Bluesky is the most-followed account on the platform with 15.9 million followers.\\n\\nThe table below shows the rest of the top-5 most-followed accounts on the platform at the time of writing.\\n\\nTop 5 most-followed Bluesky accounts | Number of followers |\\n| Bluesky (@bsky.app) | 15.9 million |\\n| Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@aoc.bsky.social) | 914,000 |\\n| George Takei (@georgetakei.bsky.social) | 797,000 |\\n| The New York Times (@nytimes.com) | 725,000 |\\n| The Onion (@theonion.com) | 704,000 |\\n\\nSource: VQV.APP\\n\\n### 14. The most-liked post on Bluesky has 242.3k likes\\n\\nAccording to Bluesky\\u0019s feed of most popular posts on platforms by likes, the most-liked post is from Bluesky themselves (@bsky.app), in which they celebrate reaching a million new users.\\n\\nThe second most-liked post is another celebratory post from Bluesky (222.3k likes), and the third is from Mark Hamill (@markhamillofficial.bsky.social) with a joke about quitting Twitter (170.1k likes).\\n\\nSource: Bluesky2\\n\\n### 15. There are over 50,000 custom feeds on Bluesky\\n\\nOne of the things that differentiates Bluesky from competitors like X is that it offers \\u0018algorithmic choice\\u0019 by letting users create their own custom feeds to determine what content they see.\\n\\nAlternatively, they can deploy custom feeds that other users have created from the open marketplace. Over 50k custom feeds have been built so far.\\n\\n## Bluesky traffic & app downloads\\n\\nBelow you\\u0019ll find traffic statistics from Similarweb that reveal insights about Bluesky\\u0019s website visitors.\\n\\n### 16. People visited the Bluesky website over 75.8 million times last month\\n\\nAccording to Similarweb\\u0019s traffic data, the Bluesky website (bsky.app) had around 75.8 million total website visits. Note that this doesn\\u0019t mean Bluesky had over 75.8 million *unique *visitors\\u0014many of those visits will be repeat visits from the same users.\\n\\nSource: Similarweb\\n\\n### 17. The average visit duration for Bluesky is 9 minutes, 46 seconds\\n\\nThis should be a fairly good indication of the typical Bluesky session duration, i.e. how long the average user stays on Bluesky when they open the app/website.\\n\\nSource: Similarweb\\n\\n### 18. Bluesky is downloaded around 400k times a day\\n\\nAt the time of writing, Bluesky is downloaded around 400k times per day, on average. It overtook X (which has 250k daily downloads, on average) for the first time this month (November 2024).\\n\\nSource: Appfigures\\n\\n### 19. Bluesky was downloaded 3.2 million times last month\\n\\nUsers downloaded Bluesky around 3.2 million times in October 2024. That figure was even higher in September at 5.1 million.\\n\\nSource: Similarweb2\\n\\n### 20. Bluesky was downloaded over 9 million times in the second half of 2024\\n\\nAnd we\\u0019re not even at the end of the year yet, so expect that figure to increase. In comparison, Bluesky was downloaded only 1.4 million times in the first half of 2024.\\n\\nSource: Business of Apps\\n\\n### 21. Bluesky recently became the #1 top-performing app in the App Store\\n\\nIn November 2024, Bluesky became the #1 app in Apple\\u0019s App Store charts, with rival Threads in the #2 spot. The App Store charts rank apps based on download and revenue velocity, which suggests Bluesky is one of the fastest-growing apps this month.\\n\\nSource: Forbes, Apple\\n\\n## Bluesky demographics\\n\\nWhat demographics make up Bluesky\\u0019s user base? Let\\u0019s look at some more Bluesky statistics to find out.\\n\\n### 22. 64% of Bluesky users are male\\n\\nAlmost two-thirds of those who visit Bluesky are male (64%), while only a little over one-third are female (36%). This is based on traffic data from Similarweb as Bluesky hasn\\u0019t publicly shared its own internal data about user demographics.\\n\\nSource: Similarweb\\n\\n### 23. 42% of Bluesky users are 18 to 24 years old\\n\\nIt seems that Bluesky primarily appeals to younger users. According to Similarweb\\u0019s traffic data, around 42% of visitors to the site are between the ages of 18 to 24.\\n\\nAge | % of Bluesky website traffic |\\n| 18-24 | 42% |\\n| 25-34 | 27.5% |\\n| 35-44 | 13.3% |\\n| 45-54 | 7.7% |\\n| 55-64 | 5.6% |\\n| 65+ | 3.8% |\\n\\nSource: Similarweb\\n\\n### 24. 37.7% of Bluesky\\u0019s traffic comes from Brazil\\n\\nAccording to Similarweb, Brazil accounts for a greater portion of Bluesky\\u0019s website traffic than any other country. It\\u0019s followed by the US (25.6%), Japan (8.7%), and the UK (3.8%).\\n\\nBluesky\\u0019s Jay (@jay.bsky.team) also confirmed in a recent post that the US, Japan, and Brazil are the three biggest countries using the app.\\n\\nSource: Similarweb, Bluesky1\\n\\n## Misc. Bluesky statistics\\n\\nBefore we wrap up, here are a few more stats about Bluesky that you might find interesting.\\n\\n### 25. Bluesky currently only has around 20 full-time employees\\n\\nThat works out at around a million users per employee, but Bluesky has said that they\\u0019re hiring, so expect this number to shoot up soon.\\n\\nSource: Bluesky3\\n\\n### 26. Bluesky has raised $23 million in funding\\n\\nThat includes a more recent $15 million series A funding round and an $8 million seed round in 2023.\\n\\nSource: TechCrunch\\n\\n### 27.

Staying true to internet tradition, it was a simple yet iconic declaration: \\u0018First!\\u0019\\n\\nSource: Bluesky4\\n\\n## Final thoughts\\n\\nAs these stats show, Bluesky is currently one of the fastest-growing social media apps.\\n\\nIt\\u0019s successfully capitalized on the controversy surrounding X and is siphoning its users at an alarming rate.\\n\\nWhether or not it will maintain its current growth rate remains to be seen. But if it does, it could spell disaster for competitors X and Threads.\\n\\nVery few [social media schedulers](https://adamconnell.me/social-media-scheduler-tools/) support the platform which is likely an issue for some.

One answer is its \\u001cmarketplace of algorithms\\u001d that lets users choose or create custom feeds based on preferences. With over 50k custom feeds available, Bluesky offers a unique degree of flexibility in shaping one\\u0019s experience. The platform also includes user-managed moderation and labeling services, plus user-made \\u001cstarter packs\\u001d that help newcomers jump in with relevant communities.\\n\\nIn terms of corporate identity, Bluesky operates as a Public Benefit Corporation, with ownership primarily held by CEO Jay Graber and the Bluesky team. They are supported by a board that features notable innovators like Jeremie Miller (inventor of Jabber/XMPP), Mike Masnick, and Kinjal Shah. This structure preserves the platform\\u0019s focus on growing and promoting open-source technology for decentralized public conversation.\\n\\nBluesky\\u0019s handle system is another hallmark. Instead of relying on standard \\u001ccheckmarks,\\u001d the platform uses domain name-based handles that require users to prove domain ownership. This approach aims to preserve authenticity and give creators independence in self-identification.\\n\\n**Who Owns Bluesky?**\\n\\nOriginally a Twitter-side project in 2019, Bluesky spun off in 2021 as an independent company and Public Benefit Corporation. Today, CEO Jay Graber \\u0014 previously behind the event-coordination platform \\u001cHappening\\u001d \\u0014 owns much of Bluesky, while the rest is distributed among the internal team.\\n\\nThe board includes:\\n\\n**Jeremie Miller**: Renowned for inventing Jabber/XMPP.**Mike Masnick**: Founder of TechDirt and the Copia Institute think tank.**Kinjal Shah**: General partner at Blockchain Capital.\\n\\nFormer Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who started the Bluesky initiative, left the board in May 2024. Post-departure, Dorsey directed a significant $5 million investment to Nostr, another decentralized platform. Meanwhile, Bluesky secured $5 million in funding \\u0014 led by Blockchain Capital \\u0014 in October 2024. So far, the company has raised $36 million in total, opting against traditional advertising and exploring subscription models instead.\\n\\n**Explosive User Growth in 2024-2025**\\n\\nSeptember 2024 was pivotal for Bluesky: the platform went from 9 million users to 20 million by November, marking a jaw-dropping 189% growth rate that month \\u0014 plus a 284% spike in daily active users.\\n\\nAlthough growth slowed a bit in December, there was still a solid 9.6% increase in US website visits, easily outpacing competitor Threads, which slipped by 1.6%. Globally, Bluesky\\u0019s momentum in December 2024 looked like this:\\n\\n**Monthly Growth**\\n\\nPlatform | Oct 2024 | Nov 2024 | Dec 2024 |\\n| Bluesky | 11.23% | 75.15% | 9.5% |\\n| Threads | 9.05% | 8.13% | 5.7% |\\n| X | 6.93% | -2.27% | 2.4% |\\n\\n[Proxidize](https://proxidize.com/blog/bluesky-user-count-2025/)\\n\\nNotably, the presidential election news in November 2024 acted as a huge catalyst, leading Bluesky to dominate the US App Store rankings for more than a week. High-profile users \\u0014 including celebrities, journalists, and creators \\u0014 flocked to the platform, driving up engagement by as much as tenfold for some organizations.\\n\\nBy the end of 2024, Bluesky\\u0019s worldwide growth had shot up by 930% year-over-year, while its two-year growth topped 30,564%. That performance solidified Bluesky\\u0019s status as a serious contender in the [social media](https://proxidize.com/blog/social-media-management/) network space.\\n\\n**Key Growth Catalysts and Milestones**\\n\\n**US Presidential Election Impact**\\n\\nThe US presidential election in November 2024 set off a surge of 13 million new users in just six weeks. During the window of November 6-15, daily website visits in the US ballooned by 519%, compared to average traffic for the first ten months of 2024.\\n\\nInteractions also skyrocketed, with some organizations reporting a 2x to 10x jump in engagement. Unsurprisingly, the platform processed a record-breaking 6.5 million content violation reports \\u0014 a 17-fold leap from the previous year.\\n\\n**Brazil Market Expansion**\\n\\nA temporary ban of X in Brazil led to Bluesky registering 2.6 million new users in a single week. Of those, a staggering 85% were from Brazil, fundamentally [reshaping the platform\\u0019s user demographics](https://proxidize.com/blog/geolocation-testing/):\\n\\nRegion | Traffic Share |\\n| Brazil | 37.7% |\\n| United States | 25.6% |\\n| Other Markets | 36.7% |\\n\\n[Proxidize](https://proxidize.com/blog/bluesky-user-count-2025/)\\n\\nThis sudden growth led to a backlog in user-managed moderation and labelling services, prompting Bluesky to scale its Portuguese-language moderation team and automate riskier areas. Simultaneously, an engineering team of 20 full-time employees (sometimes noted as 20 full-time employees) introduced new tools such as video sharing and trending topics to accommodate the larger audience.\\n\\n**Bluesky Statistics**\\n\\nRecent [demographic data](https://proxidize.com/use-cases/market-research/) offers a deep dive into Bluesky\\u0019s usage statistics. Notably, male users make up about 69.63% of the audience, while female users account for roughly 30.37%.\\n\\n**Age and Gender Distribution**\\n\\nThe average user on Bluesky skews young, with 42% in the 18-24 bracket:\\n\\nAge Group | Percentage |\\n| 18-24 | 42.0% |\\n| 25-34 | 27.5% |\\n| 35-44 | 13.3% |\\n| 45-54 | 7.7% |\\n| 55-64 | 5.6% |\\n| 65+ | 3.8% |\\n\\n[Proxidize](https://proxidize.com/blog/bluesky-user-count-2025/)\\n\\nAltogether, 70% of active users are under 34, reflecting a strong foothold among younger demographics. Engagement metrics are equally robust: the average visit durations are 9 minutes 46 seconds, with 1.51 pages viewed per session.\\n\\nIn terms of traffic sources, direct access accounts for 44.1% of visits, referrals generate 29.06%, organic search pulls 21.26%, and social media funnels 4.79%.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the platform\\u0019s lean workforce \\u0014 about 20 full-time employees and 100 contractors \\u0014 has managed to support the rising exodus of users from rival platforms while keeping moderation operations stable.\\n\\n**Website Traffic Analysis**\\n\\nIn December 2024, Bluesky recorded 154.68 million monthly website visits \\u0014 up 93% from October. The table below illustrates the platform\\u0019s top traffic sources:\\n\\n**Direct**: 44.1%**Referral**: 29.06%**Organic Search**: 21.26%**Social Media**: 4.79%\\n\\n**App Download Statistics**\\n\\nMonthly app downloads remained consistently high in 2024:\\n\\nMonth (2024) | Downloads |\\n| September | 2.85M |\\n| October | 2.76M |\\n| November | 7.85M |\\n| December | 1.76M |\\n\\n[Proxidize](https://proxidize.com/blog/bluesky-user-count-2025/)\\n\\nClearly, November was a surge in usage, coinciding with a broader exodus of users from competing services.\\n\\n**User Engagement Rates**\\n\\nUsage statistics also underscore Bluesky\\u0019s impressive engagement. On average, visitors spend around 9 minutes and 46 seconds per session. Overall figures include:\\n\\n**Total posts**: 973.80 million**Total follows**: 1.982 billion**Total likes**: 4.698 billion\\n\\nPublishers see some of the biggest gains, often experiencing 3-4x more clicks and conversions than on rival platforms. For instance, The Boston Globe logged a 4.5x increase in conversions to paid subscriptions via Bluesky compared to other social media service sites.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nFrom 9 million to 25 million users in just a few months, Bluesky\\u0019s meteoric rise speaks for itself. The platform\\u0019s decentralization, block feature, and algorithmic choice have proven especially appealing to users looking for a social platform that puts them in control.\\n\\n**Key Takeaways:**\\n\\n**Young, Global Demographic**: 42% of users are 18-24, with Brazil at 37.7% of traffic and the US at 25.6%.**Decentralized Platform**: Built on the AT Protocol, offering over 50k custom feeds and user-managed moderation.**Explosive Growth**: Jumped from 9M to 20M users in two months, peaking with a 189% monthly growth rate and 930% year-over-year increase.**Election & Brazil Ban Boost**: US presidential election added 13M users in six weeks; X\\u0019s ban in Brazil brought 2.6M users in one week.**High Engagement**: Average session lasts 9 minutes 46 seconds; total posts at 973.80M, total follows at 1.982B, total likes at 4.698B.**Bright Outlook**: Annual growth of 930% and two-year growth of 30,564% underscore Bluesky\\u0019s appeal as a fast-scaling social media platform.\\n\\nThe cross-border appeal \\u0014 spanning from the US to Brazil \\u0014 backs up its ambition to become more than just another social network. Average session lengths nearing 10 minutes and triple-digit traffic growth show that this social media app is managing to sustain engagement, even with a relatively small employee base.\\n\\nPerhaps most notably, Bluesky\\u0019s annual growth of 930% and two-year growth hitting 30,564% confirm its ability to scale and keep pace with user demand. As daily users continue to climb, the platform\\u0019s future looks bright, thanks to its decentralized platform model, user-focused features, and an ever-expanding user base that craves genuine engagement.\\n\\n**Sources:**\\n\\n## Frequently Asked Questions\\n\\n**Is Bluesky growing?**\\n\\nAs of December 2024, Bluesky has surpassed 25 million users and has grown by around 466,500 new users daily.

The platform has a significant number of daily unique posters, estimated at around 1.3 million.\n\n3. **Posting Activity**: The total number of posts on Bluesky has reached 973.80 million, with users creating tens of thousands of posts daily. As of March 2025, approximately 1.18 million posts have been made, equating to about 35 posts per user.\n\n4. **Engagement**: User engagement is high, with average visit durations of around 9 to 10 minutes per session. The platform has introduced new features like reply controls, profile search, trending topics, and a video tab to boost user interaction and content creation.\n\n5. **Platform Enhancements**: Continuous updates and feature additions suggest an active effort by Bluesky to enhance user experience and engagement, which could lead to increased posting activity.\n\nGiven the rapid growth in user numbers and the high level of engagement, it seems plausible that the total number of posts made on Bluesky on March 30, 2025, could exceed 4 million. However, considering the current daily posting activity and the number of daily active users, it is also possible that the total posts could remain below this threshold.\n\n**FINAL PROBABILITY**: 0.4"
