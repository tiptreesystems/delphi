  "question": "Will the global surface air temperature on April 1, 2025 be less than 14.3°C?",
  "probability": 0.25,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here are the key points relevant to the question of whether the global surface air temperature on April 1, 2025, will be less than 14.3°C:\n\n1. **Current ENSO Conditions**: \n   - La Niña conditions are currently present, with equatorial sea surface temperatures near-to-below average in the central and east-central Pacific Ocean. However, there is a significant probability (66-75%) of transitioning to ENSO-neutral conditions during March-May 2025. ENSO-neutral conditions typically lead to more average global temperature conditions compared to La Niña, which can suppress global temperatures.\n\n2. **Recent Temperature Trends**:\n   - The year 2024 was the hottest on record, and 2025 is projected to be among the warmest years. The US's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecasted a 7.1% chance that 2025 would be the warmest year on record.\n\n3. **Forecasts and Projections**:\n   - The transition from La Niña to ENSO-neutral conditions is expected to occur soon, which might lead to a moderation of the extreme temperature anomalies associated with La Niña. However, the lingering effects of La Niña and the recent warming trends suggest that temperatures could still be relatively high.\n\n4. **Copernicus Climate Pulse**:\n   - The Copernicus Climate Pulse provides near-real-time updates on global climate variables, but specific temperature forecasts for April 1, 2025, were not available in the data retrieved.\n\nGiven the transition to ENSO-neutral conditions and the recent warming trends, it is likely that global temperatures will remain elevated. However, the shift to ENSO-neutral could moderate temperatures slightly compared to a strong La Niña or El Niño event.\n\nConsidering these factors, the probability that the global surface air temperature on April 1, 2025, will be less than 14.3°C is relatively low.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.25",

La Niña’s signature is cooler-than-average surface water in the east-central tropical Pacific, stronger-than-average trade winds, more rain and clouds over Indonesia, and drier conditions over the central Pacific. El Niño is the opposite, with warmer-than-average surface water and weaker atmospheric circulation, while ENSO-neutral conditions are close to average.\n\nENSO can be predicted months in advance, and it [changes global atmospheric patterns](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/enso/how-enso-leads-cascade-global-impacts) in known ways.

OISSTv2 is often used for real-time analysis and model initialization, while ERSSTv5 is used for retrospective official ENSO diagnosis because it is more homogeneous over time, allowing for more accurate comparisons among ENSO events that are years apart. These two products may differ, particularly during ENSO events. The difference between the two datasets may be as much as 0.5 °C. Additionally in some years, the ERSSTv5 may tend to be cooler than OISSTv2 in the context of warming trends, because ERSSTv5 is expressed relative to a base period that is updated every 5 years, while the base period of OISSTv2 is updated every 10 years. In February 2021, both datasets were updated to reflect the 1991-2020 climatology period.\n\n### Recent and Current Conditions\n\nThe SST anomaly in the NINO3.4 region during the Nov-Jan 2024 season was -0.50 °C, and for the month of January 2025 it was -0.71 °C. The most recent weekly average (week centered on 12 February 2025) of the NINO3.4 index was -0.3 °C. The latest seasonal and monthly values suggest that the tropical Pacific has been experiencing weak La Niña conditions. The IRI’s definition of El Niño, like NOAA/Climate Prediction Center’s, requires that the monthly SST anomaly in the NINO3.4 region (5S-5N; 170W-120W) exceed +0.5 °C. Similarly, for La Niña, the anomaly must be -0.5 °C or colder.\n\nBoth atmospheric and oceanic conditions across the tropical Pacific now exhibit characteristics indicative of La Niña. For instance, while the traditional Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) for January 2025 was +0.8, placing it within the ENSO-neutral range, the equatorial SOI for the same month was +1.8, falling within the La Niña range. The trade winds (at 850 hPa) were stronger than normal during January 2025, and, as of mid-February 2025, they continue to be above average, while the upper-level winds (at 200 hPa) are close to average over the equatorial Pacific. Atmospheric convection over the central Pacific is strongly below normal, while above normal cloudiness is observed over Indonesia. Below-average ocean temperatures persist at d…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 386 words out of ~1341. Full content available via `btf_extract_evidence`.]"

OISSTv2 is often used for real-time analysis and model initialization, while ERSSTv5 is used for retrospective official ENSO diagnosis because it is more homogeneous over time, allowing for more accurate comparisons among ENSO events that are years apart. These two products may differ, particularly during ENSO events. The difference between the two datasets may be as much as 0.5 °C. Additionally in some years, the ERSSTv5 may tend to be cooler than OISSTv2 in the context of warming trends, because ERSSTv5 is expressed relative to a base period that is updated every 5 years, while the base period of OISSTv2 is updated every 10 years. In February 2021, both datasets were updated to reflect the 1991-2020 climatology period.\n\n### Recent and Current Conditions\n\nThe SST anomaly in the NINO3.4 region during the Nov-Jan 2024 season was -0.50 °C, and for the month of January 2025 it was -0.71 °C. The most recent weekly average (week centered on 12 February 2025) of the NINO3.4 index was -0.3 °C. The latest seasonal and monthly values suggest that the tropical Pacific has been experiencing weak La Niña conditions. The IRI’s definition of El Niño, like NOAA/Climate Prediction Center’s, requires that the monthly SST anomaly in the NINO3.4 region (5S-5N; 170W-120W) exceed +0.5 °C. Similarly, for La Niña, the anomaly must be -0.5 °C or colder.\n\nBoth atmospheric and oceanic conditions across the tropical Pacific now exhibit characteristics indicative of La Niña. For instance, while the traditional Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) for January 2025 was +0.8, placing it within the ENSO-neutral range, the equatorial SOI for the same month was +1.8, falling within the La Niña range. The trade winds (at 850 hPa) were stronger than normal during January 2025, and, as of mid-February 2025, they continue to be above average, while the upper-level winds (at 200 hPa) are close to average over the equatorial Pacific.

OISSTv2 is often used for real-time analysis and model initialization, while ERSSTv5 is used for retrospective official ENSO diagnosis because it is more homogeneous over time, allowing for more accurate comparisons among ENSO events that are years apart. These two products may differ, particularly during ENSO events. The difference between the two datasets may be as much as 0.5 \\u00b0C. Additionally in some years, the ERSSTv5 may tend to be cooler than OISSTv2 in the context of warming trends, because ERSSTv5 is expressed relative to a base period that is updated every 5 years, while the base period of OISSTv2 is updated every 10 years. In February 2021, both datasets were updated to reflect the 1991-2020 climatology period.\\n\\n### Recent and Current Conditions\\n\\nThe SST anomaly in the NINO3.4 region during the Nov-Jan 2024 season was -0.50 \\u00b0C, and for the month of January 2025 it was -0.71 \\u00b0C. The most recent weekly average (week centered on 12 February 2025) of the NINO3.4 index was -0.3 \\u00b0C. The latest seasonal and monthly values suggest that the tropical Pacific has been experiencing weak La Ni\\u00f1a conditions. The IRI\\u2019s definition of El Ni\\u00f1o, like NOAA/Climate Prediction Center\\u2019s, requires that the monthly SST anomaly in the NINO3.4 region (5S-5N; 170W-120W) exceed +0.5 \\u00b0C. Similarly, for La Ni\\u00f1a, the anomaly must be -0.5 \\u00b0C or colder.\\n\\nBoth atmospheric and oceanic conditions across the tropical Pacific now exhibit characteristics indicative of La Ni\\u00f1a. For instance, while the traditional Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) for January 2025 was +0.8, placing it within the ENSO-neutral range, the equatorial SOI for the same month was +1.8, falling within the La Ni\\u00f1a range. The trade winds (at 850 hPa) were stronger than normal during January 2025, and, as of mid-February 2025, they continue to be above average, while the upper-level winds (at 200 hPa) are close to average over the equatorial Pacific. Atmospheric convection over the central Pacific is strongly below normal, while above normal cloudiness is observed over Indonesia. Below-average ocean temperatures persist at d\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 386 words out of ~1341.

      "content": "Based on the gathered evidence, here are the key points relevant to the question of whether the global surface air temperature on April 1, 2025, will be less than 14.3°C:\n\n1. **Current ENSO Conditions**: \n   - La Niña conditions are currently present, with equatorial sea surface temperatures near-to-below average in the central and east-central Pacific Ocean. However, there is a significant probability (66-75%) of transitioning to ENSO-neutral conditions during March-May 2025. ENSO-neutral conditions typically lead to more average global temperature conditions compared to La Niña, which can suppress global temperatures.\n\n2. **Recent Temperature Trends**:\n   - The year 2024 was the hottest on record, and 2025 is projected to be among the warmest years. The US's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecasted a 7.1% chance that 2025 would be the warmest year on record.\n\n3. **Forecasts and Projections**:\n   - The transition from La Niña to ENSO-neutral conditions is expected to occur soon, which might lead to a moderation of the extreme temperature anomalies associated with La Niña. However, the lingering effects of La Niña and the recent warming trends suggest that temperatures could still be relatively high.\n\n4. **Copernicus Climate Pulse**:\n   - The Copernicus Climate Pulse provides near-real-time updates on global climate variables, but specific temperature forecasts for April 1, 2025, were not available in the data retrieved.\n\nGiven the transition to ENSO-neutral conditions and the recent warming trends, it is likely that global temperatures will remain elevated. However, the shift to ENSO-neutral could moderate temperatures slightly compared to a strong La Niña or El Niño event.\n\nConsidering these factors, the probability that the global surface air temperature on April 1, 2025, will be less than 14.3°C is relatively low.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.25"
