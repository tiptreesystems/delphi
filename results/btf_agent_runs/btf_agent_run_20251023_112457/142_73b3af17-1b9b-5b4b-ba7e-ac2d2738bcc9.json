  "question": "Will Kalshi rank between 11th and 20th (inclusive) in the iPhone Top Free Finance Apps on March 31, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.3,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence:\n\n1. **Kalshi's Recent Performance**: Kalshi was ranked first in the Apple App Store's financial category on the morning of the 2024 U.S. presidential election and third overall among free apps. This indicates that Kalshi can achieve high rankings during significant events.\n\n2. **Current Ranking**: As of March 24, 2025, Kalshi is not listed in the top 50 iPhone Top Free Finance Apps. This suggests a significant drop from its previous high rankings.\n\n3. **Competition**: The apps currently ranked between 11th and 20th include well-established financial services like Experian, Rocket Money, Robinhood, and others. The top 10 apps are dominated by major players such as Intuit Credit Karma, Cash App, PayPal, and Venmo, indicating strong competition.\n\n4. **CEO's Statement**: The CEO of Kalshi mentioned being \"back in the top 10,\" which implies a recent high ranking, but this is not reflected in the current list.\n\n5. **Market Dynamics**: Kalshi's ability to rank highly during specific events (like elections) suggests that its ranking can be volatile and event-driven.\n\nGiven these factors, while Kalshi has demonstrated the ability to rank highly during specific events, its current absence from the top 50 suggests it may struggle to reach the 11th to 20th range by March 31, 2025, without a significant event or change in market dynamics.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.3",

Meanwhile, Polymarket is the fourth-highest ranking app in the finance app category.\n\nThis represents both apps' highest placement to date, likely driven by interest in betting on election outcomes. Prediction markets give users a way to wager on the likelihood of future events. In theory, bettors are incentivized to present their unbiased view if money is on the line, meaning platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi provide a different view into the election than polls.\n\nBoth platforms allow users to place bets in various election-related markets — like the outcome of swing state races or the winner of the presidential contest, but only Kalshi is available to U.S. users. Kalshi's market for whether former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris will win grew to $247 million as of Nov. 5.\n\nPolymarket maintains [$3.26 billion](https://polymarket.com/event/presidential-election-winner-2024?tid=1730822483400) in total betting volume for the 2024 U.S. presidential winner, making it the largest market on the application.

      "content": "Based on the gathered evidence:\n\n1. **Kalshi's Recent Performance**: Kalshi was ranked first in the Apple App Store's financial category on the morning of the 2024 U.S. presidential election and third overall among free apps. This indicates that Kalshi can achieve high rankings during significant events.\n\n2. **Current Ranking**: As of March 24, 2025, Kalshi is not listed in the top 50 iPhone Top Free Finance Apps. This suggests a significant drop from its previous high rankings.\n\n3. **Competition**: The apps currently ranked between 11th and 20th include well-established financial services like Experian, Rocket Money, Robinhood, and others. The top 10 apps are dominated by major players such as Intuit Credit Karma, Cash App, PayPal, and Venmo, indicating strong competition.\n\n4. **CEO's Statement**: The CEO of Kalshi mentioned being \"back in the top 10,\" which implies a recent high ranking, but this is not reflected in the current list.\n\n5. **Market Dynamics**: Kalshi's ability to rank highly during specific events (like elections) suggests that its ranking can be volatile and event-driven.\n\nGiven these factors, while Kalshi has demonstrated the ability to rank highly during specific events, its current absence from the top 50 suggests it may struggle to reach the 11th to 20th range by March 31, 2025, without a significant event or change in market dynamics.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.3"
