From viral TikTok audios to historical drag advocacy, its impact extends beyond entertainment. With growing political opposition, protecting drag as an art form is more crucial than ever.\nsitename: The Gavel\ndate: 2025-03-11\ncategories: ['Culture']\n---\nRegardless of whether you are an avid fan, a casual watcher, or indifferent towards RuPaul’s Drag Race, you cannot deny the impact that it has had on Gen Z culture. For those of you who may think you’ve never seen or even heard of it, various memes and references that have pervaded social media might make you reconsider.\n\nFor starters, much of Gen Z lingo gains its traction and popularity through RuPaul’s Drag Race. Terms and phrases like *mother*, *gagged*, *snatched*, *it’s giving/serving*, *I’m living for*, and *spill the tea* were incorporated into mass media mostly after they had been used in the show. Many individuals use phrases that either originated or gained popularity in the program without realizing it.\n\nRuPaul’s Drag Race has a gold mine of memes. Have you ever heard the TikTok audio, “Is it me? Am I the drama? I don’t think I’m the drama,”? That’s a quote from drag queen Scarlet Envy from All Stars season 6. How about, “I have one thing to say: You better work, bitch!”? That’s RuPaul herself in the Supermodel music video. We have the very talented comedy queen Trixie Mattel to thank for her popular quote on the audience she draws in: “I’m big with teens, girls, lesbians, the mentally ill, the very sad, folk music enthusiasts.”\n\nRuPaul’s Drag Race and the drag culture surrounding RuPaul have indeed been snubbed in modern media when it comes to giving proper credit for the jokes and online references that much of Gen Z humor seems to be built on.\n\nPerhaps this is indicative of drag culture in general. Of course, drag has revolutionized [fashion and beauty](https://www.nssgclub.com/en/fashion/39463/sharpay-evans-best-looks-high-school-musical), with queens transforming runways in creative ways by challenging conventions, exploring silhouettes, and celebrating gender expression.

[According to Truthout.org](https://truthout.org/articles/nearly-120-anti-lgbtq-bills-filed-across-the-us-before-2025-has-even-started/), in late December 2024, there were about 120 anti-trans and LGBTQ bills filed. This is also in addition to drag itself coming under fire, with [Drag Story Hour ](https://www.dragstoryhour.org/)and other events facing protests and even violent threats.\n\nYou’d think this storm of legal and social attacks against the community would push many folks back against the wall, but through art, culture, music and more, we’ve seen just the opposite with the strength of drag.\n\n“I’m honored to be a part of the queer community and the LGBTQIA+ rainbow,” said [Alaska](https://rupaulsdragrace.fandom.com/wiki/Alaska), a famous drag queen most known for season 5 and season 2 All Stars of “RuPaul’s Drag Race.” “We make the world a more beautiful place and a more tolerable place. And we also know how to organize and kick some ass when we have to—and that’s pretty fierce.”\n\nIn New York, the biggest stages in the world are embracing drag, reserving lead roles and even an entire show for drag performers. “Cabaret” featured Marty Lauter as a cast member and the understudy to the lead role—Lauter is also known as [Marcia Marcia Marcia ](https://rupaulsdragrace.fandom.com/wiki/Marcia_Marcia_Marcia)and notably competed on “RuPaul’s Drag Race” on season 15.\n\nOther roles held by drag performers include [Jinkx Monsoon](https://rupaulsdragrace.fandom.com/wiki/Jinkx_Monsoon) in “Chicago” and “Little Shop of Horrors”, [Nina West](https://rupaulsdragrace…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 331 words out of ~1264.

From viral TikTok audios to historical drag advocacy, its impact extends beyond entertainment. With growing political opposition, protecting drag as an art form is more crucial than ever.\nsitename: The Gavel\ndate: 2025-03-11\ncategories: ['Culture']\n---\nRegardless of whether you are an avid fan, a casual watcher, or indifferent towards RuPaul’s Drag Race, you cannot deny the impact that it has had on Gen Z culture. For those of you who may think you’ve never seen or even heard of it, various memes and references that have pervaded social media might make you reconsider.\n\nFor starters, much of Gen Z lingo gains its traction and popularity through RuPaul’s Drag Race. Terms and phrases like *mother*, *gagged*, *snatched*, *it’s giving/serving*, *I’m living for*, and *spill the tea* were incorporated into mass media mostly after they had been used in the show. Many individuals use phrases that either originated or gained popularity in the program without realizing it.\n\nRuPaul’s Drag Race has a gold mine of memes. Have you ever heard the TikTok audio, “Is it me? Am I the drama? I don’t think I’m the drama,”? That’s a quote from drag queen Scarlet Envy from All Stars season 6. How about, “I have one thing to say: You better work, bitch!”? That’s RuPaul herself in the Supermodel music video. We have the very talented comedy queen Trixie Mattel to thank for her popular quote on the audience she draws in: “I’m big with teens, girls, lesbians, the mentally ill, the very sad, folk music enthusiasts.”\n\nRuPaul’s Drag Race and the drag culture surrounding RuPaul have indeed been snubbed in modern media when it comes to giving proper credit for the jokes and online references that much of Gen Z humor seems to be built on.\n\nPerhaps this is indicative of drag culture in general. Of course, drag has revolutionized [fashion and beauty](https://www.nssgclub.com/en/fashion/39463/sharpay-evans-best-looks-high-school-musical), with queens transforming runways in creative ways by challenging conventions, exploring silhouettes, and celebrating gender expression.

From viral TikTok audios to historical drag advocacy, its impact extends beyond entertainment. With growing political opposition, protecting drag as an art form is more crucial than ever.\\nsitename: The Gavel\\ndate: 2025-03-11\\ncategories: ['Culture']\\n---\\nRegardless of whether you are an avid fan, a casual watcher, or indifferent towards RuPaul\\u2019s Drag Race, you cannot deny the impact that it has had on Gen Z culture. For those of you who may think you\\u2019ve never seen or even heard of it, various memes and references that have pervaded social media might make you reconsider.\\n\\nFor starters, much of Gen Z lingo gains its traction and popularity through RuPaul\\u2019s Drag Race. Terms and phrases like *mother*, *gagged*, *snatched*, *it\\u2019s giving/serving*, *I\\u2019m living for*, and *spill the tea* were incorporated into mass media mostly after they had been used in the show.

How about, \\u201cI have one thing to say: You better work, bitch!\\u201d? That\\u2019s RuPaul herself in the Supermodel music video. We have the very talented comedy queen Trixie Mattel to thank for her popular quote on the audience she draws in: \\u201cI\\u2019m big with teens, girls, lesbians, the mentally ill, the very sad, folk music enthusiasts.\\u201d\\n\\nRuPaul\\u2019s Drag Race and the drag culture surrounding RuPaul have indeed been snubbed in modern media when it comes to giving proper credit for the jokes and online references that much of Gen Z humor seems to be built on.\\n\\nPerhaps this is indicative of drag culture in general. Of course, drag has revolutionized [fashion and beauty](https://www.nssgclub.com/en/fashion/39463/sharpay-evans-best-looks-high-school-musical), with queens transforming runways in creative ways by challenging conventions, exploring silhouettes, and celebrating gender expression.

For those of you who may think you\\u2019ve never seen or even heard of it, various memes and references that have pervaded social media might make you reconsider.\\n\\nFor starters, much of Gen Z lingo gains its traction and popularity through RuPaul\\u2019s Drag Race. Terms and phrases like *mother*, *gagged*, *snatched*, *it\\u2019s giving/serving*, *I\\u2019m living for*, and *spill the tea* were incorporated into mass media mostly after they had been used in the show.

How about, \\u201cI have one thing to say: You better work, bitch!\\u201d? That\\u2019s RuPaul herself in the Supermodel music video. We have the very talented comedy queen Trixie Mattel to thank for her popular quote on the audience she draws in: \\u201cI\\u2019m big with teens, girls, lesbians, the mentally ill, the very sad, folk music enthusiasts.\\u201d\\n\\nRuPaul\\u2019s Drag Race and the drag culture surrounding RuPaul have indeed been snubbed in modern media when it comes to giving proper credit for the jokes and online references that much of Gen Z humor seems to be built on.\\n\\nPerhaps this is indicative of drag culture in general. Of course, drag has revolutionized [fashion and beauty](https://www.nssgclub.com/en/fashion/39463/sharpay-evans-best-looks-high-school-musical), with queens transforming runways in creative ways by challenging conventions, exploring silhouettes, and celebrating gender expression.
