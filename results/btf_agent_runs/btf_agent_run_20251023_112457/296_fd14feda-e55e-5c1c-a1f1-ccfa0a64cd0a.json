  "question": "Will the number of confirmed cases in the Texas measles outbreak be between 250 and 500 (inclusive) by April 7, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.7,
  "reasoning": "Based on the latest information from the Texas Department of State Health Services, as of March 25, 2025, there have been 327 confirmed cases of measles in Texas since late January. The outbreak is primarily affecting the South Plains and Panhandle regions of Texas. Given the highly contagious nature of measles, additional cases are likely to occur in the outbreak area and surrounding communities.\n\nConsidering the current number of cases (327) and the likelihood of additional cases occurring due to the contagious nature of the disease, it seems plausible that the number of confirmed cases could reach or exceed 500 by April 7, 2025. However, the question specifically asks if the number will be between 250 and 500 (inclusive).\n\nGiven that the current number is already 327 and the trend suggests more cases are expected, the probability that the number of cases will remain between 250 and 500 by the resolution date is moderate to high. However, if the outbreak continues to grow rapidly, there is a risk that the number could exceed 500.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.7",

At this time, 327 cases have been identified since late January. Forty of the patients have been hospitalized.\n\nThere has been one fatality in a school-aged child who lived in the outbreak area. The child was not vaccinated and had no known underlying conditions.\n\nDue to the highly contagious nature of this disease, additional cases are likely to occur in the outbreak area and the surrounding communities. DSHS is working with local health departments to investigate the outbreak.\n\n**We will post updates on Tuesdays and Fridays.**\n\n| County | Cases |\n|---|---|\n| Cochran | 7 |\n| Dallam | 6 |\n| Dawson | 13 |\n| Ector | 2 |\n| Gaines | 226 |\n| Garza | 1 |\n| Hale | 1 |\n| Hockley | 1 |\n| Lamar | 5 |\n| Lamb | 1 |\n| Lubbock | 10 |\n| Lynn | 1 |\n| Martin | 3 |\n| Terry | 37 |\n| Yoakum | 13 |\nTotal |\n327 |\n\nAll data is provisional and subject to change.\n\n| 0 - 4 years | 5 - 17 years | 18+ years | Pending |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 105 | 140 | 63 | 19 |\n\n| Unvaccinated/Unknown | 325 |\n| Vaccinated: 1 dose | 0 |\n| Vaccinated: 2+ doses | 2 |\n\n- Note: The unvaccinated/unknown category includes people with no documented doses of measles vaccine more than 14 days before symptom onset.\n\nAfter additional investigation into the details of individual measles cases, DSHS has determined that three cases previously classified as vaccinated were not vaccinated cases. Two of those cases got their vaccine doses one to two days before their symptoms started, after they had been exposed to the virus. It takes the body about 14 days after vaccination to develop immunity to measles, so people aren’t considered vaccinated until that 14-day period has passed.\n\nDSHS has determined that the third case was a Lubbock County resident who had a vaccine reaction rather than a measles infection based on the results of [MeVA testing](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/php/laboratories/genetic-analysis.html#cdc_generic_section_7-identification-of-measles-vaccine-reactions), which detected the vaccine strain. This case has been removed from the case count entirely. The measles vaccine can occasionally cause a reaction with a rash and fever that mimic measles, but it is not…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 428 words out of ~703.

Two of those cases got their vaccine doses one to two days before their symptoms started, after they had been exposed to the virus. It takes the body about 14 days after vaccination to develop immunity to measles, so people aren\\u2019t considered vaccinated until that 14-day period has passed.\\n\\nDSHS has determined that the third case was a Lubbock County resident who had a vaccine reaction rather than a measles infection based on the results of [MeVA testing](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/php/laboratories/genetic-analysis.html#cdc_generic_section_7-identification-of-measles-vaccine-reactions), which detected the vaccine strain. This case has been removed from the case count entirely. The measles vaccine can occasionally cause a reaction with a rash and fever that mimic measles, but it is not\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 428 words out of ~703.

      "content": "Based on the latest information from the Texas Department of State Health Services, as of March 25, 2025, there have been 327 confirmed cases of measles in Texas since late January. The outbreak is primarily affecting the South Plains and Panhandle regions of Texas. Given the highly contagious nature of measles, additional cases are likely to occur in the outbreak area and surrounding communities.\n\nConsidering the current number of cases (327) and the likelihood of additional cases occurring due to the contagious nature of the disease, it seems plausible that the number of confirmed cases could reach or exceed 500 by April 7, 2025. However, the question specifically asks if the number will be between 250 and 500 (inclusive).\n\nGiven that the current number is already 327 and the trend suggests more cases are expected, the probability that the number of cases will remain between 250 and 500 by the resolution date is moderate to high. However, if the outbreak continues to grow rapidly, there is a risk that the number could exceed 500.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.7"
