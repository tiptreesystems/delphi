  "question": "Will Elon Musk, Donald Trump, or JD Vance visit Fort Knox before April 1, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.6,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, there are several indications that Elon Musk and Donald Trump have expressed interest in visiting Fort Knox to verify the gold reserves. Here are the key points:\n\n1. **Elon Musk's Interest and Plans**: Elon Musk has announced plans to conduct an in-person audit of Fort Knox's gold reserves. He has been actively posting about this issue on social media, indicating a strong interest in confirming the existence of gold at Fort Knox.\n\n2. **Donald Trump's Statements**: Donald Trump has publicly stated that Elon Musk would be checking out Fort Knox to ensure the gold is still there. Trump has mentioned plans to open up the doors and inspect Fort Knox, suggesting a potential visit.\n\n3. **Recent Developments**: The articles and statements are recent, with discussions and plans for a visit being mentioned in February 2025. This timing is close to the present date of March 24, 2025, indicating that the visit could happen soon.\n\n4. **Treasury Secretary's Willingness**: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has expressed willingness to arrange an inspection for interested parties, which could facilitate the visit.\n\n5. **High-Profile Attention**: The involvement of high-profile figures like Elon Musk and Donald Trump has amplified calls for transparency regarding the gold reserves, increasing the likelihood of a visit.\n\nGiven these factors, there is a reasonable probability that either Elon Musk or Donald Trump will visit Fort Knox before the deadline of April 1, 2025. However, there is no confirmed report of the visit having already occurred.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.6",

I had the privilege of experiencing numerous thought-provoking presentations, from the transformative impact of AI and disruptive technologies on businesses, to the vital role of health and wellbeing in fostering a learning-driven workforce. I’m excited to share a full recap of my experience and highlight my favorite speeches in next week’s Frank Talk blog.\n\nAs I reflect on these discussions, one thing that stands out is the growing importance of investing wisely in times of uncertainty—something especially relevant as we see gold prices hitting record highs.\n\nGold prices surged to an all-time high of $2,940 per ounce on Thursday, pushing its market cap above $20 trillion for the first time ever, as trade tensions between the U.S. and Europe have stoked fears of a global economic slowdown. And while safe-haven demand is certainly a driver, there’s another potential catalyst that could send prices soaring even higher: the revaluation of America’s gold reserves.\n\nAs many of you are aware, the U.S. holds the most gold of any country on earth by far, with reserves totaling 8,133 metric tons. But what’s less well-known is that the stockpile’s value has remained at just $42 per ounce since 1973, putting its total value at around $11 billion.\n\nLet’s say we were to revalue those reserves at today’s price of around $2,900, which some people are in favor of. The total value, then, would jump to a staggering $760 billion, creating a [windfall of $749 billion.](https://fortune.com/2025/02/11/adjusting-bookkeeping-america-gold-reserves-add-750-billion-treasury-overnight/)\n\nThis could provide the government with options to sell a portion of its gold or enhance its balance sheet by reducing debt. It could even be used to fund a Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF), which I [wrote about earl…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 383 words out of ~5980. Full content available via `btf_extract_evidence`.]"

We want to see lots of nice, beautiful, shiny gold in Fort Knox.”\n\nGiven the pivotal role gold plays in both historical and modern financial systems, proving that Fort Knox holds the expected **147.3 million ounces** (worth about $428 billion at today’s prices) is essential. The implications of a shortfall could be profound, triggering market instability, devaluing the US dollar, and causing gold prices to skyrocket.\n\n**Market confidence and stability**\n\nThe perception that Fort Knox houses one of the largest gold reserves in the world helps underpin confidence in the US financial system. If a full audit were to reveal that the reserves are lower than reported, it could send shockwaves through global markets, prompting a selloff of US assets and creating a ripple effect across international markets.\n\nThe last full audit of the depository was in 1953. In 1974, journalists and Congress members took a brief tour, often mistaken for an inspection. Since then, only routine vault seal checks have occurred, with access limited to Treasury officials like Steve Mnuchin in 2017.\n\n**Impact on the US dollar**\n\nAlthough the US dollar is no longer backed by gold, the presence of a substantial gold reserve provides an implicit assurance of stability. If Fort Knox were found to contain less gold than expected, confidence in the dollar could erode, leading to depreciation. This decl…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 374 words out of ~1881.

Where would the gold have gone?\n\n“If the gold isn’t there, we’re going to be very upset,” Trump said.\n\nMusk, the world’s richest man, who was traveling with the Republican president aboard Air Force One, has spent days posting about this issue.\n\n“Who is confirming that gold wasn’t stolen from Fort Knox?” he wrote Monday. “Maybe it’s there, maybe it’s not.”\n\n“LIVESTREAM IT,” someone commented. Musk responded with two fire emojis.\n\nMusk and Trump could ask Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about the issue.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, [he was asked](https://x.com/DanODonnellShow/status/1892323088924082232) about the conspiracy theory by Dan O’Donnell, a talk show host in Wisconsin.\n\n“We do an audit every year,” Bessent said. “All the gold is present and accounted for.”\n\n“This is something that people are apparently very concerned about,” O’Donnell said. “Elon Musk has been promising to verify that the gold is still there.”\n\nBessent said he would be happy to arrange an inspection for any senator who is interested.\n\nThe United States Bullion Depository at Fort Knox has stored precious metal bullion reserves for the United States since 1937 and has become…\n\n[Truncated preview: showing 361 words out of ~1007.

We want to see lots of nice, beautiful, shiny gold in Fort Knox.”\n\nGiven the pivotal role gold plays in both historical and modern financial systems, proving that Fort Knox holds the expected **147.3 million ounces** (worth about $428 billion at today’s prices) is essential. The implications of a shortfall could be profound, triggering market instability, devaluing the US dollar, and causing gold prices to skyrocket.\n\n**Market confidence and stability**\n\nThe perception that Fort Knox houses one of the largest gold reserves in the world helps underpin confidence in the US financial system.

We want to see lots of nice, beautiful, shiny gold in Fort Knox.\\u201d\\n\\nGiven the pivotal role gold plays in both historical and modern financial systems, proving that Fort Knox holds the expected **147.3 million ounces** (worth about $428 billion at today\\u2019s prices) is essential. The implications of a shortfall could be profound, triggering market instability, devaluing the US dollar, and causing gold prices to skyrocket.\\n\\n**Market confidence and stability**\\n\\nThe perception that Fort Knox houses one of the largest gold reserves in the world helps underpin confidence in the US financial system.

I had the privilege of experiencing numerous thought-provoking presentations, from the transformative impact of AI and disruptive technologies on businesses, to the vital role of health and wellbeing in fostering a learning-driven workforce. I\\u2019m excited to share a full recap of my experience and highlight my favorite speeches in next week\\u2019s Frank Talk blog.\\n\\nAs I reflect on these discussions, one thing that stands out is the growing importance of investing wisely in times of uncertainty\\u2014something especially relevant as we see gold prices hitting record highs.\\n\\nGold prices surged to an all-time high of $2,940 per ounce on Thursday, pushing its market cap above $20 trillion for the first time ever, as trade tensions between the U.S. and Europe have stoked fears of a global economic slowdown. And while safe-haven demand is certainly a driver, there\\u2019s another potential catalyst that could send prices soaring even higher: the revaluation of America\\u2019s gold reserves.\\n\\nAs many of you are aware, the U.S. holds the most gold of any country on earth by far, with reserves totaling 8,133 metric tons. But what\\u2019s less well-known is that the stockpile\\u2019s value has remained at just $42 per ounce since 1973, putting its total value at around $11 billion.\\n\\nLet\\u2019s say we were to revalue those reserves at today\\u2019s price of around $2,900, which some people are in favor of. The total value, then, would jump to a staggering $760 billion, creating a [windfall of $749 billion.](https://fortune.com/2025/02/11/adjusting-bookkeeping-america-gold-reserves-add-750-billion-treasury-overnight/)\\n\\nThis could provide the government with options to sell a portion of its gold or enhance its balance sheet by reducing debt. It could even be used to fund a Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF), which I [wrote about earl\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 383 words out of ~5980.

We want to see lots of nice, beautiful, shiny gold in Fort Knox.\\u201d\\n\\nGiven the pivotal role gold plays in both historical and modern financial systems, proving that Fort Knox holds the expected **147.3 million ounces** (worth about $428 billion at today\\u2019s prices) is essential. The implications of a shortfall could be profound, triggering market instability, devaluing the US dollar, and causing gold prices to skyrocket.\\n\\n**Market confidence and stability**\\n\\nThe perception that Fort Knox houses one of the largest gold reserves in the world helps underpin confidence in the US financial system. If a full audit were to reveal that the reserves are lower than reported, it could send shockwaves through global markets, prompting a selloff of US assets and creating a ripple effect across international markets.\\n\\nThe last full audit of the depository was in 1953. In 1974, journalists and Congress members took a brief tour, often mistaken for an inspection. Since then, only routine vault seal checks have occurred, with access limited to Treasury officials like Steve Mnuchin in 2017.\\n\\n**Impact on the US dollar**\\n\\nAlthough the US dollar is no longer backed by gold, the presence of a substantial gold reserve provides an implicit assurance of stability. If Fort Knox were found to contain less gold than expected, confidence in the dollar could erode, leading to depreciation. This decl\\u2026\\n\\n[Truncated preview: showing 374 words out of ~1881.

Here are the key points:\n\n1. **Elon Musk's Interest and Plans**: Elon Musk has announced plans to conduct an in-person audit of Fort Knox's gold reserves. He has been actively posting about this issue on social media, indicating a strong interest in confirming the existence of gold at Fort Knox.\n\n2. **Donald Trump's Statements**: Donald Trump has publicly stated that Elon Musk would be checking out Fort Knox to ensure the gold is still there. Trump has mentioned plans to open up the doors and inspect Fort Knox, suggesting a potential visit.\n\n3. **Recent Developments**: The articles and statements are recent, with discussions and plans for a visit being mentioned in February 2025. This timing is close to the present date of March 24, 2025, indicating that the visit could happen soon.\n\n4. **Treasury Secretary's Willingness**: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has expressed willingness to arrange an inspection for interested parties, which could facilitate the visit.\n\n5. **High-Profile Attention**: The involvement of high-profile figures like Elon Musk and Donald Trump has amplified calls for transparency regarding the gold reserves, increasing the likelihood of a visit.\n\nGiven these factors, there is a reasonable probability that either Elon Musk or Donald Trump will visit Fort Knox before the deadline of April 1, 2025. However, there is no confirmed report of the visit having already occurred.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.6"
