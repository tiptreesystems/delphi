  "question": "Will Assassin's Creed Shadows rank 1st on Steam's Weekly Top Sellers chart for March 18 - 25, 2025?",
  "probability": 0.65,
  "reasoning": "Based on the gathered evidence, here is an analysis of the likelihood that \"Assassin's Creed Shadows\" will rank 1st on Steam's Weekly Top Sellers chart for March 18 - 25, 2025:\n\n1. **Critical Reception**: \"Assassin's Creed Shadows\" has received positive reviews from multiple sources, with high scores such as 9.5/10 from Analog Stick Gaming and 10/10 from Gfinity. The game is praised for its writing, protagonists, and return to stealth gameplay, which could drive strong sales.\n\n2. **Pre-Order Sales**: Ubisoft reports that pre-orders for \"Assassin's Creed Shadows\" are \"solid\" and in line with those of \"Assassin's Creed Odyssey,\" the second most successful game in the series. This indicates a strong initial interest that could translate into high sales upon release.\n\n3. **Release Timing**: The game is set to release on March 20, 2025, which is within the week of March 18-25, 2025. This timing is crucial as it aligns with the period for the Steam Top Sellers chart.\n\n4. **Market Conditions**: Ubisoft is under pressure to have a successful launch due to recent underperforming titles and company struggles. This could lead to aggressive marketing and promotional efforts to boost sales.\n\n5. **Historical Context**: While high pre-orders are a positive indicator, they do not guarantee top sales rankings, as seen with other games like \"Dragon Age: The Veilguard.\" Additionally, \"Assassin's Creed Valhalla\" remains the most successful game in the series, suggesting that while Shadows may perform well, it might not surpass Valhalla's success.\n\nConsidering these factors, the probability that \"Assassin's Creed Shadows\" will rank 1st on Steam's Weekly Top Sellers chart for the specified week is moderately high, but not certain due to competition and market dynamics.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.65",

Shadows is the most refined, balanced, and impeccably produced game in the\nsitename: XboxEra\ndate: 2025-03-18\ncategories: ['Reviews']\n---\n[Reviews](https://xboxera.com/category/reviews/)\n\n# Assassin’s Creed Shadows | Review\n\nAssassin’s Creed is finally set in Japan, and it has led to an instant classic. Shadows is the most refined, balanced, and impeccably produced game in the long-running franchise. As Yasuke the Samurai and Naoe the Shinobi, you’ll help the people and fight the tyrants while shaping Japan’s future. The delays were worth it; Ubisoft Montreal has crafted an epic tale.\n\n## Naoe & Yasuke\n\nFeaturing dual protagonists, Assassin’s Creed Shadows allows you to play the way you want the majority of the time. To begin, you will switch between Yasuke and Naoe as the story demands. After a few hours, it’s all Naoe all the time until you progress deep enough into the story for Yasuke to re-enter the fray. From that point on, you can choose who you want to play as outside of a few major story missions, which will show you both of their perspectives.\n\nNaoe is a shinobi from the Iga region. Her gameplay features the classic AC style full of parkour, stealth, and assassinations. She is far and away the greatest athlete the series has ever seen. Standing roughly five feet tall, her agility and speed feel amazing to control. My wife laughed at her over-the-top acrobatics as she did full Olympic gymnast dismounts from any decent height.\n\nYasuke is known as “The Giant” throughout the land. Standing an imposing (at the time) 6 feet tall, with broad shoulders, he fights like the brutes from past titles. While Naoe’s stealth is good fun, Yasuke’s brute force will make you feel like a monster. He can climb a bit, though finding most eagle perch synchronization spots will require Naoe’s grappling hook and skills. I highly recommend doing leaps of faith, another series staple, with Yasuke. He’s so damned big and heavy in his armor that, well you should see for yourself.\n\n## Feudal Japan\n\nAs amazing as the characters, story, gameplay, and music are, the star of the game is the world. Back at Gamescom 2024, I got to see a behind-closed-doors presentation on the improvements made to the Anvil engine. Wind, leaves, particulate- it’s all real, and it has spoiled other games.\n\nIt is a country of rough weather with distinct seasons. The Anvil Engine handles all of it beautifully, with heavy winds blowing leaves of all different shades around and rain cascading off of roofs as it builds up on your character. I mostly played on GeForce Now to start with before shifting to Xbox Series X & PC once those builds were ready. No matter where I played the game, it looked and ran well, feeling extremely polished and well optimized.\n\nXbox Series X Quality (30fps) and Balanced (40fps) modes look gorgeous, with the Performance (60fps) mode looking damned good, with some noticeable lighting downgrades. Running maxed out on GeForce Now with a 4080 or my local PC with a 7900xtx, I got a locked 60+ fps at Ultra settings.\n\nIt is one of the greatest-looking pieces of media I have ever seen. Feudal Japan is a perfect play space for Ubisoft’s artists to build a stunningly realized world full of life, color, and danger. Seeing the morning sun shining through the trees, how it properly cascades and shines through various material types, you have to see it.\n\nI cannot overstate how amazing the lighting is, and when you add in the physical wind interactivity with grass, bushes, and trees shaking around, it is an astounding technical achievement.\n\nAlso, I have to call out how incredible the facial animations are. One of the biggest improvements over passed titles, there are times the characters look completely human, with cutscenes shifting to 30fps on all platforms to up the texture and animation quality to its max level.\n\n## ASSASSINO!\n\nAll of this brilliant world-building and feel is in service of AC Shadow’s fantastic gameplay. We’ll start with Naoe and her Shinobi style. For fans of the series, she is the greatest playing protagonist yet. Her focus is on parrying white and blue-colored incoming strikes and dodging the red-colored ones.\n\nYour quick attack is on the right bumper, with heavy on the right trigger. The left bumper is used for parrying, and B is dodge. The left trigger activates your ranged abilities and ally call-ins (more on that later).\n\nNaoe has the following melee and ranged options:**Melee**: Katana, Tanto, and Kusarigama**Ranged**: Kunai, Shuriken, Bell, Smoke Bomb\n\n**Skill Tree:** Katana, Tanto, Kusarigama, Tools, Assassin, Shinobi\n\nAlongside all of this is the classic hidden blade, allowing her to quickly dispatch foes in a single blow as long as the number of health segments she can remove in one attack is more than their health bar. You start with the katana, and while it looks great, she’s weak in one-on-one fights. I preferred having the tanto out as it allows for dual assassinations, where she’ll use the short tanto blade and her hidden blade in unison.\n\nThe Kusarigama is best for groups of enemies as you swing the heavy spike ball around on its chain while using the sickle for short-range hits. Kunai are heavy throwing daggers that can take out most regular enemies in a single headshot, while the shuriken (ninja stars) are best used in combo with your melee attacks as they are quick but low damage. While the small bell is great for distracting enemies away from a particular location, the greatest tool is the smoke bomb.\n\nTossing one of those on the ground at your enemy’s feet makes them lose track of you, opening things up for an assassination attempt. By the end of the game, my assassinations could take upwards of 7 health segments off, so using these on bosses led to incredibly quick victories.\n\n## SAM ARE I\n\nYasuke is a wholly different beast. No tools, only weapons, brute force, and heavy armor.\n\nYasuke has the following melee and ranged options:**Melee**: Long Katana, Kanabo, Naginata**Ranged**: Long Bow, Teppo (one-shot rifle)**Skill Tree: **Long Katana, Kanabo, Naginata, Long Bow, Teppo, Samurai\n\nYasuke has no hidden blade, his only assassination is of the brutal variety. He yells “I’m here” in various ways before chopping his opponent’s head off, smashing it with a hammer, or chopping both arms off and then the head with the pole sword. He is a vicious combatant who can take far more of a pounding than Naoe, which is good because he’s not the best at being silent.\n\nWhile you begin with the Long Katana, my favorite was the Kanabo. It is an enormous club that Yasuke will use to hit home runs with. Your opponent’s heads are the balls, and they will go flying. AC Shadows is a violent game, full of body parts being chopped or knocked off, with the most brutal hits turning your enemy’s domes into a fine red mist.\n\n## Skills To Pay The Bills\n\nNaoe and Yasuke both have six distinct skill trees and each tree has dozens of nodes with a few active and many passive abilities. You can have two weapons and two active abilities equipped at any time on each. Your skills can be refunded for free whenever you choose, which allowed me to experiment with different playstyles without much fuss.\n\nI’d recommend focusing on Adrenaline chunks, which are used for abilities, and health segments removed on assassination. Every tree has multiple levels, and to unlock these, you’ll need to complete various tasks given red icons across the map. These can be meditation sessions for Naoe, finding lost scrolls in temples, or horseback archery runs with Yasuke. The map has dozens, if not hundreds, of these activities, and I spent a long time on them to get the mind points necessary for unlocking new skills.\n\nSome may not appreciate the grind, but as I naturally found more than enough side activities throughout the main story, I think it is well done overall. The map in Assassin’s Creed Shadows is enormous, spanning a decent chunk of mainland Japan. Utilizing the game’s various fast travel points, you can hop between areas and find more activities without issue, and my god, is there a lot to do.\n\n## The Quest Board\n\nShadows uses a new quest board system that slowly fills up with a series of circular zones or organization-specific quests. At the start of the game, you’ll have your giant main antagonist collective circle and one for Naoe. As you meet and unlock Yasuke, quests for him will appear. As you enter all of the game’s dozens of regions and sub-regions, more and more quest circles will be unveiled.\n\nBy the time the full credits had rolled and I had played through the epilogue section, I was at roughly 50 hours. If I focused on just the main quest, I doubt I could have properly beaten things on normal difficulty in less than 30. With everything left on my map by the “end” and how the story leads to potential new adventures, I could see many having their 100+ hour playtimes like they did in Valhalla.\n\nWhere that game suffered, its pacing, Shadows does not. Never once did I feel forced to do side content. I focused on and did it because it was so damned good and/or fun. I didn’t care if it was “fetch quest 40” in nature because of how damned good the game looked, sounded, and played while I was doing it.\n\nYasuke and Naoe each have their own horses, and you can bring up a “take me here” guidance line, though there is no “press a button to auto travel along it” anymore. I still had a solid 33% of the map left to explore after the credits rolled, with more areas and the factions within them littering my already enormous quest board.\n\nI don’t know that the number of quests is that much higher than in past games. The layout is, though, and you now always see exactly how much you’ve completed every time you look to do something new in the game’s vast, sweeping story.\n\n## Shinobi Rising, Revengeance\n\nAssassins Creed Shadows allows you two story options to start with: choose your own adventure or canon mode. I did the “make your own story choices” style during my preview and chose to play through the canon version of events for my review. For the RPG fans out there, you will get a surprisingly different version of events, including the potential losses of allies that do not occur in the canon version.\n\nAt one point, I had to rescue a friend that I had been working with throughout 10+ missions. There was no warning or timer on the screen; it just said “rescue x”. I messed up a few jumps and all of a sudden heard a gunshot. My “rescue x” changed to “avenge x” and my heart dropped. I quickly reloaded the last checkpoint to see if I could save them, and lo and behold, I could.\n\nWhen I properly executed each jump, I stopped the would-be killer right before his shot hit and saved my ally. From that point on, they were an option to assist me in fights and spent their time with me at our home base (more on that in a bit). Shadow’s story is full of choices and consequences. How do you choose to react, and what does that mean for the future? Can you forgive, and if so, was it the right decision?\n\nI saw that side of things in my preview of the game and admit it’s not what I come to AC games for. I’m all for the option to have a canon mode, which let me not worry about fully micro-managing my choices. Thankfully, I lucked out and saved my entire family in AC Odyssey, but I labored over the choices. Here, I was safe to follow Naoe and Yasuke on their path as they found allies, helped the people, and came to terms with their trauma.\n\n## There’s No Place Like Home\n\nSpeaking of allies, early on in Naoe’s story, you’ll unlock the hideout. This home base is a little homestead builder, full of buildings, paths, decorations, pets, and more to place in it. As you travel the lands, loot chests, complete quests, and visit vendors, you’ll find hundreds of items to decorate the hideout to match what you want.\n\nThe main buildings offer passive benefits like extra scouts, whom you’ll use to help you find objectives. Without them, you’re given a main area, sub-region, and subber-sub-region to try and find your target in. Scouts can also take marked resources from inside strongholds, which they’ll retrieve for you at the end of a season.\n\nSeasons change slowly throughout the game, though you can choose to jump to the next one from the map when it’s close enough. Spring, Fall, Winter, Summer- they’re all here in various fashions, and they’ll completely change up the map, clear your local bounties, and refresh your scout supply.\n\nOne of the buildings you’ll unlock is a scout hub, with many of them also dotting each city you visit. For 800 mon (in-game currency), you can unlock them as fast travel and scout/ally hub spots. There are systems on systems, with dojos that let you train up your allies so that they’re more powerful when you call them in. One of the first allies I found was named Yaya, a giant of a woman. After upgrading her, she’d run in and choke-slam any poor bastard who dared get in her way.\n\nIf you want to get your interior decorator on, then the hunt for new items and the ease with which you can place them should see dozens of hours lost. To build new buildings that give benefits, you’ll need materials, which are some of the main benefits of looting castles and other various strongholds. Many nights were spent scouring the map for new places to rob from the shadows as Naoe or blast through as Yasuke.\n\n## A New ‘Do\n\nI won’t get into any story specifics as I like to keep it as spoiler-free as possible. Naoe and Yasuke will travel across various lands with less of a focus on the overarching Assassin vs. Templar narrative than previous games. It is still very much there, and when it comes to the front, it is brilliant. To even get to all this, though, you’ll have to go through the new AC Nexus launcher.\n\nAssassin’s Creed Shadows is the first game to use this new Animus Hub, where each of the recent titles from Origins to now is available to launch (as long as you own them and they’re installed). It isn’t the Call of Duty HQ app, you’re still loading each game individually. It’s the front end that does all the work.\n\nIn that front end, you’ll have the Memories (games), any new Animus-focused story segments, a content library, and free in-game reward tracks (battle passes). There are two of the “battle passes” to start with, and to progress along them, you’ll do daily and weekly in-game quests to gain keys. These keys get you items, and there is already a full microtransaction store that gets you level-appropriate gear with incredibly over-the-top looks.\n\nWithout spending a penny, I had enough in-game mtx money to buy a few items and had progressed a decent way through the first “battle pass”. I’m sure people will be furious about it for a week or two, but this system is nothing new and not nearly as egregious as the one they tried way back with Unity.\n\n## Feudal Funk\n\nFinally, I’d like to talk about the game’s vibes. It is feudal Japan, full of nanban like the Portuguese who are slowly trying to dominate the region. As the slave Diogo, you’ll fight against this to become the samurai Yasuke. Ubisoft Montreal never hold back from calling Yasuke what he is, the respect he commands, nor do they shy away from his terrible past.\n\nNaoe is a young woman at the start, living with her father in a small village a few years after her mother’s death. Finding out what happened to her, who her father truly is (she gets a hidden blade for a reason!), and where her tale takes her is a delight. The friendship she forms with Yasuke feels natural, at least in the canon mode, and the way the story leaves off ties up every main question I had while offering up intriguing new ones for future content in this stunningly realized world.\n\nThe music is a blend of classical tunes and full location-appropriate instruments without ever feeling like a parody. Funky fight music carries battles while sweeping tracks add to the grandeur of every vista. There is a canon voice mode as well, featuring the correct languages for each character, mainly Japanese and Portuguese, as needed. I used this for most of my playthrough, opting for English when my eyes grew tired from reading subtitles. The canon voice acting is excellent, while the English voice acting has a generally high level with the occasional off-performance.\n\nI was completely satisfied with the game’s story and how it ended. Things aren’t wrapped up with a neat bow, and I fully expect a lot more content in the future starring these characters. Whether it’s only expansions or full sequels, I cannot wait to head back to Japan to continue this league’s expertly crafted journey.\n\n## Wrapping Things Up\n\nThere’s so much more I could talk about but… [spoilers](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/assassins-creed-shadows/9NRRMKB49KQP). Assassin’s Creed: Shadows is the best entry in the series. There is no area in which it is lacking, with expert pacing despite its enormous size. Naoe and Yasuke shine as dual protagonists, as does Japan itself. This one has been my favorite in a year of amazing releases.\n\n### Assassin's Creed Shadows\n\n###### Played on\n\n##### Xbox Series X (main) & PC\n\n#### PROS\n\n- A Living, Breathing World\n- Excellent Story\n- Fantastic Gameplay\n- Gorgeous Soundtrack\n- Just Damned Cool\n\n#### CONS\n\n- A few of the English VOs are Weak"

Naoe and Yasuke are my definitive heroes for this series, two individuals who are wonderfully portrayed by their respective actors, and the talented team that brought them to life.\n\n[-](https://opencritic.com/outlet/885/atarita)\n\n**Atarita**[Alparslan Gürlek](https://opencritic.com/critic/7536/alparslan-g-rlek)-\n\n*Turkish*-\n\n[84 / 100](https://www.atarita.com/assassins-creed-shadows-inceleme/)\n\nAssassin's Creed Shadows has taken a long-overdue step forward with its new mechanics and technical improvements.

The setting is breathtaking, the variety in the missions is great and the gameplay feels very well thought out. The interaction between Yasuke and Naoe in particular creates an interesting dynamic. While Yasuke excels in combat, Naoe offers probably the best parcours gameplay the series has ever had. Traversal with Yasuke, the actual story and the typical open-world problems do tarnish the whole thing somewhat, but the series certainly wasn't this good for a while.\n\n[-](https://opencritic.com/outlet/563/checkpoint-gaming)\n\n**Checkpoint Gaming**[Edie W-K](https://opencritic.com/critic/6031/edie-w-k)-\n\n[9 / 10](https://checkpointgaming.net/reviews/2025/03/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\nAssassin's Creed Shadows is another notch in the belt of this illustrious series. Sneaking and stabbing as Naoe or duelling foes in honourable combat as Yasuke, the duel protagonists are a genius addition to all the things we love about Assassin's Creed. Even though I haven't gelled with the more recent huge open-world AC titles, I leave my time with Assassin's Creed Shadows with renewed excitement for the series thanks to a more manageable map size and a great story.

The contrast between Naoe and Yasuke offers distinct playstyles, encouraging variety and experimentation. Stealth mechanics are more polished than ever, while combat, though not as deep as a pure action game, remains fun and well-balanced.\n\nFeudal Japan is recreated with exceptional detail, thanks to top-tier artistic direction and a solid technical foundation, benefiting from the departure from old consoles. The seasonal cycle isn’t just aesthetic but adds meaningful gameplay dynamics, keeping exploration engaging.\n\nHowever, some concerns remain. The Animus Hub feels more like an unfinished concept than a true revolution, and the modern-day storyline risks becoming secondary again. Some design choices, like character switching, could have been smoother.\n\nOverall, Assassin’s Creed Shadows delivers an immersive experience that will satisfy longtime fans eager for this setting within the series' lore, as well as newcomers drawn by its Eastern allure.\n\n[-](https://opencritic.com/outlet/863/dexerto)\n\n**Dexerto**[Jessica Filby](https://opencritic.com/critic/9424/jessica-filby)-\n\n[4 / 5](https://www.dexerto.com/assassins-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-the-best-since-black-flag-3164004/)\n\nAssassin's Creed has been fighting to find its identity for over a decade, and thanks to Shadows it's finally rediscovered it. Sure, its combat can be clunky and some story beats felt oddly placed (particularly Yasuke's backstory), but Shadows is exactly what Assassin's Creed needed to prove it still has a beating heart. Whether you’re looking to explore the stunning world of feudal Japan, storm the gates of an enemy castle, or fall in love with the many NPCs that populate its world, Assassin's Creed Shadows is an immersive treat that cements itself as the best Assassin's Creed game since Black Flag.\n\n[-](https://opencritic.com/outlet/944/digitale-anime)\n\n**Digitale Anime**[Raouf Belhamra](https://opencritic.com/critic/11073/raouf-belhamra)-\n\n*Arabic*-\n\n[9 / 10](https://ar.digitaleanime.dz/archives/63927)\n\n\"A worthy heir to a venerable lineage\" Assassin's Creed Shadows offers one of the most distinctive stealth and infiltration experiences in the series, thanks to its dual-hero system and richly detailed world.

It may not change your mind about the Ubisoft formula of open-world games.\n\nBut through it all, formulas work because they're comfort food and deliver what is expected while looking darn good and polished doing so, without any fuss.

Assassin's Creed Shadows makes the most of that theme, with a great pair of shinobi and samurai heroes sharing center stage that are well-written and fun to skulk through giant castles or wade into vicious battles with. Besides the setting, the bulk of the changes this time focus on making smaller tweaks to well-established systems, such as less cluttered maps and skill trees, while also doubling down on things that really worked in 2023’s Assassin’s Creed Mirage, like the more focused and tougher combat that accompanies its better paced main quests. It’s not a perfect reset, as imbalances and missed opportunities abound, but I feel more confident than ever that Assassin’s Creed could be back and here to stay.\n\nLike a river in the rainy season, Shadows’ story overflows with cliches that are signature to fiction set in this era. Warriors wander the land to bring honor to themselves and their masters. Absent rulers let wealthy bureaucrats exploit the poor. Bandits hold the countryside in the cold grip of fear. If you’re a fan of James Clavell’s Shogun or the excellent movies of Akira Kurosawa, you have certainly seen the bulk of what protagonists Yasuke and Naoe are made to navigate. This isn’t a bad thing, and morally complex intersecting plots still keep the intrigue high, which is the same trick that made Assassin’s Creed Valhalla’s stories work when they did. I don’t think I was particularly wowed by the writing on a regular basis, but there are some standout moments of tense reflection and curious happenings sprinkled throughout. The typical Assassin’s Creed conspiracy woven into it fits perfectly within the war torn Sengoku period of Japan, too, like a hidden blade snugly in its wrist sheath.\n\nThe leads themselves are wonderful. You spend a lot of the early game with the sharp-witted and broody Naoe, who is among the last shinobi warriors of the Iga clan, a role thrust upon her by tragedy. That tragedy befell her in part by the hands of the charismatic hulk Yasuke, who is a tireless warrior for justice and peace. When they begin working together, they are frequently each other’s most reliable consul, with sound and often different perspectives on the events going on around them. In other words, they truly do balance one another, and while I don’t think either one would win popularity contests against other series stars like Ezio or Edward, together they serve as the bright light in the center of a largely dark tale of revenge.\n\nThe story overall is paced similarly to Valhalla, where the cardinal reason to be in each of the nine regions of the map is to play through a mostly self-contained chapter. That said, Shadows does a better job of making sure at least some story elements and characters don’t just completely vanish when you leave a region the way they did in its predecessor. Not every new lord or business man you meet becomes completely irrelevant after you’ve solved their problems. I also found these sections, and the overall time it took to move from chapter to chapter, to be more brisk and less filled with frustrating filler than past games. It’s still a bit too full of “go here, do that” as bridges between major moments than I’d prefer, but it's organized in a way that can be enjoyed in pieces and at your leisure without getting too lost between plot points, almost like how one might read a good book.\n\nMost of the missions in Shadows start on the objective board, a bigger and more elaborate chart of people that need assistance and targets that need eliminating adapted from Assassin’s Creed Mirage. Thematically, this approach matches the tone of using all the information you gather to identify hidden members of the secret society trying to plunge Japan into chaos. Functionally, the way it organizes outstanding tasks and the people involved is far more useful than the old bulleted quest lists. It does trade some of the magic of exploration away as a cost of this efficacy, though. More than once I organically stumbled across a jerk that couldn’t be talked down, just to kill them and find not only his crossed out profile tacked to my board, but also the exact number of remaining silhouettes of the gang I had no idea they were a part of until right then. But it’s a trade I would make every time.\n\nSelecting a quest gave me a short list of clues to help discern where the objective was, which is easier to figure out depending on how well I’d searched that part of the map already. Past games have given hints to identify targets like this before, hoping to create some friction between you and the effort to find your quarry, but Shadows is the first one that I felt constantly made me look at my map and actually deduce where the spot in question might be by using those clues and some educated guesses. I could use scouts, one of the assets you can develop at your hideout, to assist in the narrowing process, pinging an area on the map and highlighting unidentified objectives in the zone. This doesn't reveal hidden locations or features of the map outside of just a marker though, so it's a bad way to clear fog of war from a distance. It will also cost one scout whether they find something or not, and scouts are replenished in very few ways, so scouting can be a real risk if you’re trying to make progress in the main story – especially early on.\n\nRather than lighting up your map with a galaxy of tooltips, Shadows mostly relies on sparse point-of-interest icons to push you towards the areas you’ll need to see the finer details of in-person. Even when you climb up to the signature highpoints to take a good long look at your surroundings, what you’ll see is a bevy of nondescript icons that tell you that *something *is out there, but you’re gonna have to hop down from that perch and go check them out for yourself to know what. I love this – I could feel my brain starting to detangle the checklist conditioning that years of these games had instilled in me. Not only did I feel compelled to just ride through the countryside and genuinely explore stuff without much expectation of grand rewards, I also felt no nagging compulsion to check off every possible thing to do in a region inorganically.\n\nMost of these undiscovered locations fall into one of a number of reliable categories, like castles you can infiltrate and attempt to steal special gear from or any of the many villages scattered across Japan, but you can’t be sure unless you take it in for yourself. A common thing I would always stop to handle whenever I came across them were world activities – these are smaller locations and events that, when completed, add knowledge points to your characters, increasing their knowledge levels and adding new options to their skill trees. Not all of these events are exciting, with running around temples to find missing scroll pages being my least favorite, but they often don’t take too long and the points are worth it in the end. And in the case of something like the horse archery challenges, they can add an interesting distraction from the action for a short spell.\n\nBetween outings, I spent some time at the hideout, this iteration of Valhalla’s Ravensthorpe settlement. After collecting minerals, crops, and wood out in the world, you can use those resources to build and upgrade important buildings here that give you access to new assets. I spent the majority of my time at the forge managing my equipment, while other important buildings provide more passive additions or have features that can be managed in places outside of the hideout, like the new summoning ability from the dojo which let me call in help from certain allies I met during my adventure. I’m glad I didn’t have to dote on this place very much as I personally can’t be bothered to decorate a homestead, but for those interested in that sort of thing I was absolutely flooded by the cosmetics I unlocked just in the natural course of completing tasks and looting, so you’ll never be starved for options to spice the place up.\n\nThe real sightseeing, though, is out in the world. 1500s Japan is a beautiful place – there’s such a symphony of color over every hill and across every lake. Each season brings with it incredible landscapes, sometimes covered in the reddish brown of Autumn or entombed in deep white snow. In fact, I found the weather to be some of the best I’d ever experienced in an open world. It was hard not to be moved watching powerful winds pick up and bring in rolling thunderstorms, especially when watching how nature reacted to it all in real time, as flocks of birds took flight and ground critters scurry around to find safety. And not for nothing, but in my dozens of hours in Shadows I encountered remarkably few bugs for a game this size.\n\nThe main 40-hour story revolves around the dual protagonists attempting to unmask and eliminate members of a deadly organization called the Shinbakufu. Once you’ve chosen a target, the multi-mission arcs give you regular opportunities to handle a situation with either Yasuke’s might or Naoe’s stealth. However, while there are certainly scenarios where one is more useful than the other, in general, there are remarkably few quests where Naoe isn’t better suited for the task at hand. This comes down to how their abilities are divided between them. If the classic Assassin’s Creed playstyle is the combination of exploration, parkour, stealth, and combat, Naoe can do all of these competently and excels at parkour and stealth. Yasuke, meanwhile, can’t climb very well or sneak around much due to his size and general lack of grace. He is a devastating force in combat – maybe the most overbearing and dominant protagonist in the series – but Naoe can simply sneak around most situations that Yasuke would cut his way through, solving them with so much less trouble if done well. As much as I like Yasuke, he’s far more limited and one dimensional in his style, with large parts of this game not quite designed to take advantage of his strengths in a way that feels intentional.\n\nIt's particularly disappointing because Shadows does find ways to tailor missions around both of their skills on occasion, usually in bigger, more pivotal and important battles where both heroes need to operate together to succeed. These special missions are separated into sections that allow you to choose which character to proceed with, changing what’s asked of you depending on your choice. In a later game mission, Naoe is securing the perimeter of the castle walls, taking out gunmen, while Yasuke storms the place demanding to challenge this chapter’s foe to a duel for the lives of his hostages. Depending on who you play as, you’re either weaving through blockades to drop specific soldiers without alerting the whole castle, or you’re having a fierce duel against a powerful samurai. It's awesome, and made the more homogenous space between these moments a real bummer.\n\nCombat overall is more challenging than in the past. Enemies, especially in groups, are more aggressive, relying on combos and unblockable attacks as often as possible. They also tend to have solid defenses, both in that they block a lot and also in that many of them are armored, essentially giving them a second life bar. Effectively taking them down means having a solid defense of your own, dodging and deflecting their blows to make them vulnerable, and taking advantage before they recover. It requires a more thoughtful execution of your various abilities than previous games have, and I never felt like combat was a chore in and of itself – though the camera really struggled to keep all of the action in frame, and doubly so when inside buildings.\n\nStraightforward combat really sings when playing as Yasuke, whose set of swords, naginata, kanabo, bows, and even guns are all perfect for decimating enemies. He is a juggernaut of a man outside of his toys, being able to literally run through walls and shake the earth with his blows. He’s also tough and can take many more blows before succumbing to his wounds. Naoe is very fragile by comparison, and while capable of doing lots of damage when enemies are vulnerable, she struggles to stagger them without the help of her tools. She gets overwhelmed easily by mobs, especially well-armored bruisers, and when the numbers get above three or four foes, I almost always found it better to drop a smoke bomb and disappear versus attempting to fight them all in an open melee.\n\nOn the flipside, Naoe is a menace when striking from the shadows or catching enemies unaware. This Assassin’s Creed takes the “Shadows” in its name seriously, with darkness being a key part of her stealth gameplan. There are some new features that help her out, like being able to crawl and dodge while prone, as well as some returning ones like her Eagle Sense, which lets you see silhouettes of enemies through walls. The long-missing double assassination is back too, and all of these add up to make Naoe one of the most robust assassins in the series. Yasuke can’t hold a candle to his ninja counterpart in this arena.\n\nEnhancing your combat abilities is mercifully less tedious than Valhalla’s skill constellation. Naoe and Yasuke have skill trees focused on their weapons and specialities, with every node feeling far more impactful than simple passive damage bonuses (which still exist, but in small amounts). Gaining new abilities is obviously the most impactful, but some of the real hidden gems add new functionality to weapons, like being able to turn certain attacks with Naoe’s chain sickle into grapples that let you pull enemies into obstacles or off of cliffs. Yasuke and his abundance of weapons made for some skill trees I largely ignored, especially his bow and teppo, as he is such a close ranged juggernaut that I had a hard time justifying spending my admittedly plentiful skill points on a ranged strategy I never embraced.\n\nSpeaking of excess, Shadows takes a big step backward from the work done around your inventory in Valhalla and Mirage. There are far too many pieces of randomized, color-tiered gear to pick up from fallen foes or as forgettable quest rewards that have no chance of making it into my rotation. Base stats like damage might make them relevant as last-minute stop gaps to keep your stats in line with bad guys at your level, but only until you find that next piece of legendary gear or earn enough resources to level up a piece you already like. The skills on legendary gear, like a kanabo that turns enemies into shrapnel grenades when you break their armor, are impactful in a way that the generic percentage buffs to XYZ skill that you get from the lower tiers of gear never even come close to."

[High-profile failures like XDefiant](https://www.thegamer.com/xdefiant-shut-down-ubisoft-san-francisco-osaka-closed/), disappointing sales for games like Star Wars Outlaws, and [mass layoffs across multiple studios](https://www.thegamer.com/ubisoft-closure-studios-layoffs-185-employees/) have all contributed to the narrative that Ubisoft is currently up the creek without a paddle.\n\nAssassin's Creed Shadows has the potential to turn its fortunes around though, and [despite all the backlash surrounding Yasuke](https://www.thegamer.com/ubisoft-defends-yasuke-assassins-creed-shadows-controversy/) and [two separate delays](https://www.thegamer.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-march/), it's apparently on course to perform very well. [First reported by Eurogamer](https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-pre-orders-solid-in-line-with-series-second-biggest-launch), Ubisoft claimed in its most recent quarterly earnings call that pre-order sales are currently \"solid\".\n\n## Assassin's Creed Shadows Pre-Order Sales Are Just As Good As Odyssey's\n\nExact pre-order numbers were never revealed, but Ubisoft gives us an idea as to just how well Assassin's Creed Shadows is performing before launch by claiming the title is \"in line with those of Assassin's Creed Odyssey\", which is the second most successful game in the series.\n\nAssassin's Creed Valhalla is currently the most successful entry in the series, and it sounds as though that title isn't really under threat from Shadows.\n\nOf course, just because a game's pre-order sales are high, doesn't automatically mean it will sell like hotcakes. [Dragon Age: The Veilguard](https://www.thegamer.com/tag/dragon-age-the-veilguard/) was [one of Steam's most-pre-ordered games](https://www.thegamer.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-steam-sales-looking-strong-ahead-of-release/) during the very busy October of last year, yet it eventually went on to disappoint EA massively, [underperforming in terms of players by a whopping 50 percent](https://www.thegamer.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-bookings-revenue-below-expectations/).\n\nThese numbers coming from Ubisoft itself should be a little bit more reliable though, and if Assassin's Creed Shadows does become the second most successful game in the series behind Valhalla, then it will give the company a major boost. It can then use that to either push on and gain momentum, or as a bargaining chip in buyout talks with Tencent, [which were reportedly put on hold recently](https://www.thegamer.com/ubisoft-tencent-buyout-negotiations-on-hold-assassins-creed-shadows/).\n\n##### Assassin's Creed Shadows\n\n-\n**Released** - March 20, 2025\n-\n**ESRB** - Mature 17+ // Blood and Gore, Intense Violence, Language\n-\n**Developer(s)** - Ubisoft Quebec\n-\n**Publisher(s)** -\n[Ubisoft](https://www.thegamer.com/tag/ubisoft/)"

Shadows is the most refined, balanced, and impeccably produced game in the long-running franchise. As Yasuke the Samurai and Naoe the Shinobi, you’ll help the people and fight the tyrants while shaping Japan’s future. The delays were worth it; Ubisoft Montreal has crafted an epic tale.\n\n## Naoe & Yasuke\n\nFeaturing dual protagonists, Assassin’s Creed Shadows allows you to play the way you want the majority of the time. To begin, you will switch between Yasuke and Naoe as the story demands. After a few hours, it’s all Naoe all the time until you progress deep enough into the story for Yasuke to re-enter the fray. From that point on, you can choose who you want to play as outside of a few major story missions, which will show you both of their perspectives.\n\nNaoe is a shinobi from the Iga region. Her gameplay features the classic AC style full of parkour, stealth, and assassinations. She is far and away the greatest athlete the series has ever seen. Standing roughly five feet tall, her agility and speed feel amazing to control. My wife laughed at her over-the-top acrobatics as she did full Olympic gymnast dismounts from any decent height.\n\nYasuke is known as “The Giant” throughout the land. Standing an imposing (at the time) 6 feet tall, with broad shoulders, he fights like the brutes from past titles. While Naoe’s stealth is good fun, Yasuke’s brute force will make you feel like a monster. He can climb a bit, though finding most eagle perch synchronization spots will require Naoe’s grappling hook and skills. I highly recommend doing leaps of faith, another series staple, with Yasuke. He’s so damned big and heavy in his armor that, well you should see for yourself.\n\n## Feudal Japan\n\nAs amazing as the characters, story, gameplay, and music are, the star of the game is the world. Back at Gamescom 2024, I got to see a behind-closed-doors presentation on the improvements made to the Anvil engine. Wind, leaves, particulate- it’s all real, and it has spoiled other games.\n\nIt is a country of rough weather with distinct seasons. The Anvil Engine handles all of it beautifully, with heavy winds blowing leaves of all different shades around and rain cascading off of roofs as it builds up on your character. I mostly played on GeForce Now to start with before shifting to Xbox Series X & PC once those builds were ready. No matter where I played the game, it looked and ran well, feeling extremely polished and well optimized.\n\nXbox Series X Quality (30fps) and Balanced (40fps) modes look gorgeous, with the Performance (60fps) mode looking damned good, with some noticeable lighting downgrades. Running maxed out on GeForce Now with a 4080 or my local PC with a 7900xtx, I got a locked 60+ fps at Ultra settings.\n\nIt is one of the greatest-looking pieces of media I have ever seen. Feudal Japan is a perfect play space for Ubisoft’s artists to build a stunningly realized world full of life, color, and danger. Seeing the morning sun shining through the trees, how it properly cascades and shines through various material types, you have to see it.\n\nI cannot overstate how amazing the lighting is, and when you add in the physical wind interactivity with grass, bushes, and trees shaking around, it is an astounding technical achievement.\n\nAlso, I have to call out how incredible the facial animations are. One of the biggest improvements over passed titles, there are times the characters look completely human, with cutscenes shifting to 30fps on all platforms to up the texture and animation quality to its max level.\n\n## ASSASSINO!\n\nAll of this brilliant world-building and feel is in service of AC Shadow’s fantastic gameplay. We’ll start with Naoe and her Shinobi style. For fans of the series, she is the greatest playing protagonist yet. Her focus is on parrying white and blue-colored incoming strikes and dodging the red-colored ones.\n\nYour quick attack is on the right bumper, with heavy on the right trigger. The left bumper is used for parrying, and B is dodge. The left trigger activates your ranged abilities and ally call-ins (more on that later).\n\nNaoe has the following melee and ranged options:**Melee**: Katana, Tanto, and Kusarigama**Ranged**: Kunai, Shuriken, Bell, Smoke Bomb\n\n**Skill Tree:** Katana, Tanto, Kusarigama, Tools, Assassin, Shinobi\n\nAlongside all of this is the classic hidden blade, allowing her to quickly dispatch foes in a single blow as long as the number of health segments she can remove in one attack is more than their health bar. You start with the katana, and while it looks great, she’s weak in one-on-one fights. I preferred having the tanto out as it allows for dual assassinations, where she’ll use the short tanto blade and her hidden blade in unison.\n\nThe Kusarigama is best for groups of enemies as you swing the heavy spike ball around on its chain while using the sickle for short-range hits. Kunai are heavy throwing daggers that can take out most regular enemies in a single headshot, while the shuriken (ninja stars) are best used in combo with your melee attacks as they are quick but low damage. While the small bell is great for distracting enemies away from a particular location, the greatest tool is the smoke bomb.\n\nTossing one of those on the ground at your enemy’s feet makes them lose track of you, opening things up for an assassination attempt. By the end of the game, my assassinations could take upwards of 7 health segments off, so using these on bosses led to incredibly quick victories.\n\n## SAM ARE I\n\nYasuke is a wholly different beast. No tools, only weapons, brute force, and heavy armor.\n\nYasuke has the following melee and ranged options:**Melee**: Long Katana, Kanabo, Naginata**Ranged**: Long Bow, Teppo (one-shot rifle)**Skill Tree: **Long Katana, Kanabo, Naginata, Long Bow, Teppo, Samurai\n\nYasuke has no hidden blade, his only assassination is of the brutal variety. He yells “I’m here” in various ways before chopping his opponent’s head off, smashing it with a hammer, or chopping both arms off and then the head with the pole sword. He is a vicious combatant who can take far more of a pounding than Naoe, which is good because he’s not the best at being silent.\n\nWhile you begin with the Long Katana, my favorite was the Kanabo. It is an enormous club that Yasuke will use to hit home runs with. Your opponent’s heads are the balls, and they will go flying. AC Shadows is a violent game, full of body parts being chopped or knocked off, with the most brutal hits turning your enemy’s domes into a fine red mist.\n\n## Skills To Pay The Bills\n\nNaoe and Yasuke both have six distinct skill trees and each tree has dozens of nodes with a few active and many passive abilities. You can have two weapons and two active abilities equipped at any time on each. Your skills can be refunded for free whenever you choose, which allowed me to experiment with different playstyles without much fuss.\n\nI’d recommend focusing on Adrenaline chunks, which are used for abilities, and health segments removed on assassination. Every tree has multiple levels, and to unlock these, you’ll need to complete various tasks given red icons across the map. These can be meditation sessions for Naoe, finding lost scrolls in temples, or horseback archery runs with Yasuke. The map has dozens, if not hundreds, of these activities, and I spent a long time on them to get the mind points necessary for unlocking new skills.\n\nSome may not appreciate the grind, but as I naturally found more than enough side activities throughout the main story, I think it is well done overall. The map in Assassin’s Creed Shadows is enormous, spanning a decent chunk of mainland Japan. Utilizing the game’s various fast travel points, you can hop between areas and find more activities without issue, and my god, is there a lot to do.\n\n## The Quest Board\n\nShadows uses a new quest board system that slowly fills up with a series of circular zones or organization-specific quests. At the start of the game, you’ll have your giant main antagonist collective circle and one for Naoe. As you meet and unlock Yasuke, quests for him will appear. As you enter all of the game’s dozens of regions and sub-regions, more and more quest circles will be unveiled.\n\nBy the time the full credits had rolled and I had played through the epilogue section, I was at roughly 50 hours. If I focused on just the main quest, I doubt I could have properly beaten things on normal difficulty in less than 30. With everything left on my map by the “end” and how the story leads to potential new adventures, I could see many having their 100+ hour playtimes like they did in Valhalla.\n\nWhere that game suffered, its pacing, Shadows does not. Never once did I feel forced to do side content. I focused on and did it because it was so damned good and/or fun. I didn’t care if it was “fetch quest 40” in nature because of how damned good the game looked, sounded, and played while I was doing it.\n\nYasuke and Naoe each have their own horses, and you can bring up a “take me here” guidance line, though there is no “press a button to auto travel along it” anymore. I still had a solid 33% of the map left to explore after the credits rolled, with more areas and the factions within them littering my already enormous quest board.\n\nI don’t know that the number of quests is that much higher than in past games. The layout is, though, and you now always see exactly how much you’ve completed every time you look to do something new in the game’s vast, sweeping story.\n\n## Shinobi Rising, Revengeance\n\nAssassins Creed Shadows allows you two story options to start with: choose your own adventure or canon mode. I did the “make your own story choices” style during my preview and chose to play through the canon version of events for my review. For the RPG fans out there, you will get a surprisingly different version of events, including the potential losses of allies that do not occur in the canon version.\n\nAt one point, I had to rescue a friend that I had been working with throughout 10+ missions. There was no warning or timer on the screen; it just said “rescue x”. I messed up a few jumps and all of a sudden heard a gunshot. My “rescue x” changed to “avenge x” and my heart dropped. I quickly reloaded the last checkpoint to see if I could save them, and lo and behold, I could.\n\nWhen I properly executed each jump, I stopped the would-be killer right before his shot hit and saved my ally. From that point on, they were an option to assist me in fights and spent their time with me at our home base (more on that in a bit). Shadow’s story is full of choices and consequences. How do you choose to react, and what does that mean for the future? Can you forgive, and if so, was it the right decision?\n\nI saw that side of things in my preview of the game and admit it’s not what I come to AC games for. I’m all for the option to have a canon mode, which let me not worry about fully micro-managing my choices. Thankfully, I lucked out and saved my entire family in AC Odyssey, but I labored over the choices. Here, I was safe to follow Naoe and Yasuke on their path as they found allies, helped the people, and came to terms with their trauma.\n\n## There’s No Place Like Home\n\nSpeaking of allies, early on in Naoe’s story, you’ll unlock the hideout. This home base is a little homestead builder, full of buildings, paths, decorations, pets, and more to place in it. As you travel the lands, loot chests, complete quests, and visit vendors, you’ll find hundreds of items to decorate the hideout to match what you want.\n\nThe main buildings offer passive benefits like extra scouts, whom you’ll use to help you find objectives. Without them, you’re given a main area, sub-region, and subber-sub-region to try and find your target in. Scouts can also take marked resources from inside strongholds, which they’ll retrieve for you at the end of a season.\n\nSeasons change slowly throughout the game, though you can choose to jump to the next one from the map when it’s close enough. Spring, Fall, Winter, Summer- they’re all here in various fashions, and they’ll completely change up the map, clear your local bounties, and refresh your scout supply.\n\nOne of the buildings you’ll unlock is a scout hub, with many of them also dotting each city you visit. For 800 mon (in-game currency), you can unlock them as fast travel and scout/ally hub spots. There are systems on systems, with dojos that let you train up your allies so that they’re more powerful when you call them in. One of the first allies I found was named Yaya, a giant of a woman. After upgrading her, she’d run in and choke-slam any poor bastard who dared get in her way.\n\nIf you want to get your interior decorator on, then the hunt for new items and the ease with which you can place them should see dozens of hours lost. To build new buildings that give benefits, you’ll need materials, which are some of the main benefits of looting castles and other various strongholds. Many nights were spent scouring the map for new places to rob from the shadows as Naoe or blast through as Yasuke.\n\n## A New ‘Do\n\nI won’t get into any story specifics as I like to keep it as spoiler-free as possible. Naoe and Yasuke will travel across various lands with less of a focus on the overarching Assassin vs. Templar narrative than previous games. It is still very much there, and when it comes to the front, it is brilliant. To even get to all this, though, you’ll have to go through the new AC Nexus launcher.\n\nAssassin’s Creed Shadows is the first game to use this new Animus Hub, where each of the recent titles from Origins to now is available to launch (as long as you own them and they’re installed). It isn’t the Call of Duty HQ app, you’re still loading each game individually. It’s the front end that does all the work.\n\nIn that front end, you’ll have the Memories (games), any new Animus-focused story segments, a content library, and free in-game reward tracks (battle passes). There are two of the “battle passes” to start with, and to progress along them, you’ll do daily and weekly in-game quests to gain keys. These keys get you items, and there is already a full microtransaction store that gets you level-appropriate gear with incredibly over-the-top looks.\n\nWithout spending a penny, I had enough in-game mtx money to buy a few items and had progressed a decent way through the first “battle pass”. I’m sure people will be furious about it for a week or two, but this system is nothing new and not nearly as egregious as the one they tried way back with Unity.\n\n## Feudal Funk\n\nFinally, I’d like to talk about the game’s vibes. It is feudal Japan, full of nanban like the Portuguese who are slowly trying to dominate the region. As the slave Diogo, you’ll fight against this to become the samurai Yasuke. Ubisoft Montreal never hold back from calling Yasuke what he is, the respect he commands, nor do they shy away from his terrible past.\n\nNaoe is a young woman at the start, living with her father in a small village a few years after her mother’s death. Finding out what happened to her, who her father truly is (she gets a hidden blade for a reason!), and where her tale takes her is a delight. The friendship she forms with Yasuke feels natural, at least in the canon mode, and the way the story leaves off ties up every main question I had while offering up intriguing new ones for future content in this stunningly realized world.\n\nThe music is a blend of classical tunes and full location-appropriate instruments without ever feeling like a parody. Funky fight music carries battles while sweeping tracks add to the grandeur of every vista. There is a canon voice mode as well, featuring the correct languages for each character, mainly Japanese and Portuguese, as needed. I used this for most of my playthrough, opting for English when my eyes grew tired from reading subtitles. The canon voice acting is excellent, while the English voice acting has a generally high level with the occasional off-performance.\n\nI was completely satisfied with the game’s story and how it ended. Things aren’t wrapped up with a neat bow, and I fully expect a lot more content in the future starring these characters. Whether it’s only expansions or full sequels, I cannot wait to head back to Japan to continue this league’s expertly crafted journey.\n\n## Wrapping Things Up\n\nThere’s so much more I could talk about but… [spoilers](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/assassins-creed-shadows/9NRRMKB49KQP). Assassin’s Creed: Shadows is the best entry in the series. There is no area in which it is lacking, with expert pacing despite its enormous size. Naoe and Yasuke shine as dual protagonists, as does Japan itself. This one has been my favorite in a year of amazing releases.\n\n### Assassin's Creed Shadows\n\n###### Played on\n\n##### Xbox Series X (main) & PC\n\n#### PROS\n\n- A Living, Breathing World\n- Excellent Story\n- Fantastic Gameplay\n- Gorgeous Soundtrack\n- Just Damned Cool\n\n#### CONS\n\n- A few of the English VOs are Weak"

Shadows is the most refined, balanced, and impeccably produced game in the long-running franchise. As Yasuke the Samurai and Naoe the Shinobi, you\\u2019ll help the people and fight the tyrants while shaping Japan\\u2019s future. The delays were worth it; Ubisoft Montreal has crafted an epic tale.\\n\\n## Naoe & Yasuke\\n\\nFeaturing dual protagonists, Assassin\\u2019s Creed Shadows allows you to play the way you want the majority of the time. To begin, you will switch between Yasuke and Naoe as the story demands. After a few hours, it\\u2019s all Naoe all the time until you progress deep enough into the story for Yasuke to re-enter the fray. From that point on, you can choose who you want to play as outside of a few major story missions, which will show you both of their perspectives.\\n\\nNaoe is a shinobi from the Iga region. Her gameplay features the classic AC style full of parkour, stealth, and assassinations. She is far and away the greatest athlete the series has ever seen. Standing roughly five feet tall, her agility and speed feel amazing to control. My wife laughed at her over-the-top acrobatics as she did full Olympic gymnast dismounts from any decent height.\\n\\nYasuke is known as \\u201cThe Giant\\u201d throughout the land. Standing an imposing (at the time) 6 feet tall, with broad shoulders, he fights like the brutes from past titles. While Naoe\\u2019s stealth is good fun, Yasuke\\u2019s brute force will make you feel like a monster. He can climb a bit, though finding most eagle perch synchronization spots will require Naoe\\u2019s grappling hook and skills. I highly recommend doing leaps of faith, another series staple, with Yasuke. He\\u2019s so damned big and heavy in his armor that, well you should see for yourself.\\n\\n## Feudal Japan\\n\\nAs amazing as the characters, story, gameplay, and music are, the star of the game is the world. Back at Gamescom 2024, I got to see a behind-closed-doors presentation on the improvements made to the Anvil engine. Wind, leaves, particulate- it\\u2019s all real, and it has spoiled other games.\\n\\nIt is a country of rough weather with distinct seasons. The Anvil Engine handles all of it beautifully, with heavy winds blowing leaves of all different shades around and rain cascading off of roofs as it builds up on your character. I mostly played on GeForce Now to start with before shifting to Xbox Series X & PC once those builds were ready. No matter where I played the game, it looked and ran well, feeling extremely polished and well optimized.\\n\\nXbox Series X Quality (30fps) and Balanced (40fps) modes look gorgeous, with the Performance (60fps) mode looking damned good, with some noticeable lighting downgrades. Running maxed out on GeForce Now with a 4080 or my local PC with a 7900xtx, I got a locked 60+ fps at Ultra settings.\\n\\nIt is one of the greatest-looking pieces of media I have ever seen. Feudal Japan is a perfect play space for Ubisoft\\u2019s artists to build a stunningly realized world full of life, color, and danger. Seeing the morning sun shining through the trees, how it properly cascades and shines through various material types, you have to see it.\\n\\nI cannot overstate how amazing the lighting is, and when you add in the physical wind interactivity with grass, bushes, and trees shaking around, it is an astounding technical achievement.\\n\\nAlso, I have to call out how incredible the facial animations are. One of the biggest improvements over passed titles, there are times the characters look completely human, with cutscenes shifting to 30fps on all platforms to up the texture and animation quality to its max level.\\n\\n## ASSASSINO!\\n\\nAll of this brilliant world-building and feel is in service of AC Shadow\\u2019s fantastic gameplay. We\\u2019ll start with Naoe and her Shinobi style. For fans of the series, she is the greatest playing protagonist yet. Her focus is on parrying white and blue-colored incoming strikes and dodging the red-colored ones.\\n\\nYour quick attack is on the right bumper, with heavy on the right trigger. The left bumper is used for parrying, and B is dodge. The left trigger activates your ranged abilities and ally call-ins (more on that later).\\n\\nNaoe has the following melee and ranged options:**Melee**: Katana, Tanto, and Kusarigama**Ranged**: Kunai, Shuriken, Bell, Smoke Bomb\\n\\n**Skill Tree:** Katana, Tanto, Kusarigama, Tools, Assassin, Shinobi\\n\\nAlongside all of this is the classic hidden blade, allowing her to quickly dispatch foes in a single blow as long as the number of health segments she can remove in one attack is more than their health bar. You start with the katana, and while it looks great, she\\u2019s weak in one-on-one fights. I preferred having the tanto out as it allows for dual assassinations, where she\\u2019ll use the short tanto blade and her hidden blade in unison.\\n\\nThe Kusarigama is best for groups of enemies as you swing the heavy spike ball around on its chain while using the sickle for short-range hits. Kunai are heavy throwing daggers that can take out most regular enemies in a single headshot, while the shuriken (ninja stars) are best used in combo with your melee attacks as they are quick but low damage. While the small bell is great for distracting enemies away from a particular location, the greatest tool is the smoke bomb.\\n\\nTossing one of those on the ground at your enemy\\u2019s feet makes them lose track of you, opening things up for an assassination attempt. By the end of the game, my assassinations could take upwards of 7 health segments off, so using these on bosses led to incredibly quick victories.\\n\\n## SAM ARE I\\n\\nYasuke is a wholly different beast. No tools, only weapons, brute force, and heavy armor.\\n\\nYasuke has the following melee and ranged options:**Melee**: Long Katana, Kanabo, Naginata**Ranged**: Long Bow, Teppo (one-shot rifle)**Skill Tree: **Long Katana, Kanabo, Naginata, Long Bow, Teppo, Samurai\\n\\nYasuke has no hidden blade, his only assassination is of the brutal variety. He yells \\u201cI\\u2019m here\\u201d in various ways before chopping his opponent\\u2019s head off, smashing it with a hammer, or chopping both arms off and then the head with the pole sword. He is a vicious combatant who can take far more of a pounding than Naoe, which is good because he\\u2019s not the best at being silent.\\n\\nWhile you begin with the Long Katana, my favorite was the Kanabo. It is an enormous club that Yasuke will use to hit home runs with. Your opponent\\u2019s heads are the balls, and they will go flying. AC Shadows is a violent game, full of body parts being chopped or knocked off, with the most brutal hits turning your enemy\\u2019s domes into a fine red mist.\\n\\n## Skills To Pay The Bills\\n\\nNaoe and Yasuke both have six distinct skill trees and each tree has dozens of nodes with a few active and many passive abilities. You can have two weapons and two active abilities equipped at any time on each. Your skills can be refunded for free whenever you choose, which allowed me to experiment with different playstyles without much fuss.\\n\\nI\\u2019d recommend focusing on Adrenaline chunks, which are used for abilities, and health segments removed on assassination. Every tree has multiple levels, and to unlock these, you\\u2019ll need to complete various tasks given red icons across the map. These can be meditation sessions for Naoe, finding lost scrolls in temples, or horseback archery runs with Yasuke. The map has dozens, if not hundreds, of these activities, and I spent a long time on them to get the mind points necessary for unlocking new skills.\\n\\nSome may not appreciate the grind, but as I naturally found more than enough side activities throughout the main story, I think it is well done overall. The map in Assassin\\u2019s Creed Shadows is enormous, spanning a decent chunk of mainland Japan. Utilizing the game\\u2019s various fast travel points, you can hop between areas and find more activities without issue, and my god, is there a lot to do.\\n\\n## The Quest Board\\n\\nShadows uses a new quest board system that slowly fills up with a series of circular zones or organization-specific quests. At the start of the game, you\\u2019ll have your giant main antagonist collective circle and one for Naoe. As you meet and unlock Yasuke, quests for him will appear. As you enter all of the game\\u2019s dozens of regions and sub-regions, more and more quest circles will be unveiled.\\n\\nBy the time the full credits had rolled and I had played through the epilogue section, I was at roughly 50 hours. If I focused on just the main quest, I doubt I could have properly beaten things on normal difficulty in less than 30. With everything left on my map by the \\u201cend\\u201d and how the story leads to potential new adventures, I could see many having their 100+ hour playtimes like they did in Valhalla.\\n\\nWhere that game suffered, its pacing, Shadows does not. Never once did I feel forced to do side content. I focused on and did it because it was so damned good and/or fun. I didn\\u2019t care if it was \\u201cfetch quest 40\\u201d in nature because of how damned good the game looked, sounded, and played while I was doing it.\\n\\nYasuke and Naoe each have their own horses, and you can bring up a \\u201ctake me here\\u201d guidance line, though there is no \\u201cpress a button to auto travel along it\\u201d anymore. I still had a solid 33% of the map left to explore after the credits rolled, with more areas and the factions within them littering my already enormous quest board.\\n\\nI don\\u2019t know that the number of quests is that much higher than in past games. The layout is, though, and you now always see exactly how much you\\u2019ve completed every time you look to do something new in the game\\u2019s vast, sweeping story.\\n\\n## Shinobi Rising, Revengeance\\n\\nAssassins Creed Shadows allows you two story options to start with: choose your own adventure or canon mode. I did the \\u201cmake your own story choices\\u201d style during my preview and chose to play through the canon version of events for my review. For the RPG fans out there, you will get a surprisingly different version of events, including the potential losses of allies that do not occur in the canon version.\\n\\nAt one point, I had to rescue a friend that I had been working with throughout 10+ missions. There was no warning or timer on the screen; it just said \\u201crescue x\\u201d. I messed up a few jumps and all of a sudden heard a gunshot. My \\u201crescue x\\u201d changed to \\u201cavenge x\\u201d and my heart dropped. I quickly reloaded the last checkpoint to see if I could save them, and lo and behold, I could.\\n\\nWhen I properly executed each jump, I stopped the would-be killer right before his shot hit and saved my ally. From that point on, they were an option to assist me in fights and spent their time with me at our home base (more on that in a bit). Shadow\\u2019s story is full of choices and consequences. How do you choose to react, and what does that mean for the future? Can you forgive, and if so, was it the right decision?\\n\\nI saw that side of things in my preview of the game and admit it\\u2019s not what I come to AC games for. I\\u2019m all for the option to have a canon mode, which let me not worry about fully micro-managing my choices. Thankfully, I lucked out and saved my entire family in AC Odyssey, but I labored over the choices. Here, I was safe to follow Naoe and Yasuke on their path as they found allies, helped the people, and came to terms with their trauma.\\n\\n## There\\u2019s No Place Like Home\\n\\nSpeaking of allies, early on in Naoe\\u2019s story, you\\u2019ll unlock the hideout. This home base is a little homestead builder, full of buildings, paths, decorations, pets, and more to place in it. As you travel the lands, loot chests, complete quests, and visit vendors, you\\u2019ll find hundreds of items to decorate the hideout to match what you want.\\n\\nThe main buildings offer passive benefits like extra scouts, whom you\\u2019ll use to help you find objectives. Without them, you\\u2019re given a main area, sub-region, and subber-sub-region to try and find your target in. Scouts can also take marked resources from inside strongholds, which they\\u2019ll retrieve for you at the end of a season.\\n\\nSeasons change slowly throughout the game, though you can choose to jump to the next one from the map when it\\u2019s close enough. Spring, Fall, Winter, Summer- they\\u2019re all here in various fashions, and they\\u2019ll completely change up the map, clear your local bounties, and refresh your scout supply.\\n\\nOne of the buildings you\\u2019ll unlock is a scout hub, with many of them also dotting each city you visit. For 800 mon (in-game currency), you can unlock them as fast travel and scout/ally hub spots. There are systems on systems, with dojos that let you train up your allies so that they\\u2019re more powerful when you call them in. One of the first allies I found was named Yaya, a giant of a woman. After upgrading her, she\\u2019d run in and choke-slam any poor bastard who dared get in her way.\\n\\nIf you want to get your interior decorator on, then the hunt for new items and the ease with which you can place them should see dozens of hours lost. To build new buildings that give benefits, you\\u2019ll need materials, which are some of the main benefits of looting castles and other various strongholds. Many nights were spent scouring the map for new places to rob from the shadows as Naoe or blast through as Yasuke.\\n\\n## A New \\u2018Do\\n\\nI won\\u2019t get into any story specifics as I like to keep it as spoiler-free as possible. Naoe and Yasuke will travel across various lands with less of a focus on the overarching Assassin vs. Templar narrative than previous games. It is still very much there, and when it comes to the front, it is brilliant. To even get to all this, though, you\\u2019ll have to go through the new AC Nexus launcher.\\n\\nAssassin\\u2019s Creed Shadows is the first game to use this new Animus Hub, where each of the recent titles from Origins to now is available to launch (as long as you own them and they\\u2019re installed). It isn\\u2019t the Call of Duty HQ app, you\\u2019re still loading each game individually. It\\u2019s the front end that does all the work.\\n\\nIn that front end, you\\u2019ll have the Memories (games), any new Animus-focused story segments, a content library, and free in-game reward tracks (battle passes). There are two of the \\u201cbattle passes\\u201d to start with, and to progress along them, you\\u2019ll do daily and weekly in-game quests to gain keys. These keys get you items, and there is already a full microtransaction store that gets you level-appropriate gear with incredibly over-the-top looks.\\n\\nWithout spending a penny, I had enough in-game mtx money to buy a few items and had progressed a decent way through the first \\u201cbattle pass\\u201d. I\\u2019m sure people will be furious about it for a week or two, but this system is nothing new and not nearly as egregious as the one they tried way back with Unity.\\n\\n## Feudal Funk\\n\\nFinally, I\\u2019d like to talk about the game\\u2019s vibes. It is feudal Japan, full of nanban like the Portuguese who are slowly trying to dominate the region. As the slave Diogo, you\\u2019ll fight against this to become the samurai Yasuke. Ubisoft Montreal never hold back from calling Yasuke what he is, the respect he commands, nor do they shy away from his terrible past.\\n\\nNaoe is a young woman at the start, living with her father in a small village a few years after her mother\\u2019s death. Finding out what happened to her, who her father truly is (she gets a hidden blade for a reason!), and where her tale takes her is a delight. The friendship she forms with Yasuke feels natural, at least in the canon mode, and the way the story leaves off ties up every main question I had while offering up intriguing new ones for future content in this stunningly realized world.\\n\\nThe music is a blend of classical tunes and full location-appropriate instruments without ever feeling like a parody. Funky fight music carries battles while sweeping tracks add to the grandeur of every vista. There is a canon voice mode as well, featuring the correct languages for each character, mainly Japanese and Portuguese, as needed. I used this for most of my playthrough, opting for English when my eyes grew tired from reading subtitles. The canon voice acting is excellent, while the English voice acting has a generally high level with the occasional off-performance.\\n\\nI was completely satisfied with the game\\u2019s story and how it ended.

Whether it\\u2019s only expansions or full sequels, I cannot wait to head back to Japan to continue this league\\u2019s expertly crafted journey.\\n\\n## Wrapping Things Up\\n\\nThere\\u2019s so much more I could talk about but\\u2026 [spoilers](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/assassins-creed-shadows/9NRRMKB49KQP). Assassin\\u2019s Creed: Shadows is the best entry in the series. There is no area in which it is lacking, with expert pacing despite its enormous size.

I was obsessed with finishing the assassination targets and working through the Objective board with many late nights to see it through. The wait for Ubisoft to bring the series to Japan has been worth it, especially given the technical appeal of modern gaming making it even more impressive than I had imagined. Naoe and Yasuke are my definitive heroes for this series, two individuals who are wonderfully portrayed by their respective actors, and the talented team that brought them to life.\n\n[-](https://opencritic.com/outlet/885/atarita)\n\n**Atarita**[Alparslan Gürlek](https://opencritic.com/critic/7536/alparslan-g-rlek)-\n\n*Turkish*-\n\n[84 / 100](https://www.atarita.com/assassins-creed-shadows-inceleme/)\n\nAssassin's Creed Shadows has taken a long-overdue step forward with its new mechanics and technical improvements.

The setting is breathtaking, the variety in the missions is great and the gameplay feels very well thought out. The interaction between Yasuke and Naoe in particular creates an interesting dynamic. While Yasuke excels in combat, Naoe offers probably the best parcours gameplay the series has ever had. Traversal with Yasuke, the actual story and the typical open-world problems do tarnish the whole thing somewhat, but the series certainly wasn't this good for a while.\n\n[-](https://opencritic.com/outlet/563/checkpoint-gaming)\n\n**Checkpoint Gaming**[Edie W-K](https://opencritic.com/critic/6031/edie-w-k)-\n\n[9 / 10](https://checkpointgaming.net/reviews/2025/03/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\nAssassin's Creed Shadows is another notch in the belt of this illustrious series. Sneaking and stabbing as Naoe or duelling foes in honourable combat as Yasuke, the duel protagonists are a genius addition to all the things we love about Assassin's Creed. Even though I haven't gelled with the more recent huge open-world AC titles, I leave my time with Assassin's Creed Shadows with renewed excitement for the series thanks to a more manageable map size and a great story.

The contrast between Naoe and Yasuke offers distinct playstyles, encouraging variety and experimentation. Stealth mechanics are more polished than ever, while combat, though not as deep as a pure action game, remains fun and well-balanced.\n\nFeudal Japan is recreated with exceptional detail, thanks to top-tier artistic direction and a solid technical foundation, benefiting from the departure from old consoles.

It follows the formula of the series, without taking any risks, limiting itself to delivering a game that is consistent with what fans already know. Naoe is a nice surprise, while Yasuke doesn't seem to know what he's doing here.

It plays it too safe while trying to go back to the roots, but it also goes back on the unwanted systems, including the leveling-based progression. This “one step forward, and two steps back” sentiment makes Shadows just another entry in a long list of Assassin’s Creed games and nothing more.\n\n[-](https://opencritic.com/outlet/767/gameliner)\n\n**Gameliner**[Patrick Lamers](https://opencritic.com/critic/7468/patrick-lamers)-\n\n*Dutch*-\n\n[4 / 5](https://gameliner.nl/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review-stapt-uit-de-schaduw/6099-29-1-194)\n\nAssassin's Creed Shadows is a great step forward for the series, with an intriguing story, varied characters, and a well-executed - eventhough a little repetitive - medieval Japan setting, making it a must-have for Assassin's Creed fans and open-world adventure lovers.\n\n[-](https://opencritic.com/outlet/870/gamepressure)\n\n**Gamepressure**[Maciej Bogusz](https://opencritic.com/critic/10595/maciej-bogusz)-\n\n[7 / 10](https://www.gamepressure.com/editorials/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review-great-combat-and-stealth-where-plo/ze75b)\n\nAssassin's Creed: Shadows is a game full of contrasts. On one hand, it offers solid stealth mechanics and a great combat system, but on the other, it features a lackluster storyline and generic exploration. If you're a fan of the series, you'll likely find something to enjoy here, but if you weren't convinced from the start, the combat and stealth may not be enough to win you over.\n\n[-](https://opencritic.com/outlet/452/gamer-escape)\n\n**Gamer Escape**[Eliot Lefebvre](https://opencritic.com/critic/6542/eliot-lefebvre)-\n\n[8 / 10](https://gamerescape.com/2025/03/18/review-assassins-creed-shadows/)\n\nAnd that's really the ultimate takeaway. It has a load of really fun parts, a fun gameplay loop, an engaging story, and an earnest effort to split the difference between the various elements of the franchise history. It's a good game!

This isn’t a big revamp, nor are there any deep changes to the formula. However, it’s the best the series has been for a while.

Ubisoft has delivered the most remarkable world I think we have seen from the studio yet. This, combined with a rich setting, dynamic gameplay styles, and a good balance of action and stealth, makes Shadows the best entry in the series.

It may not change your mind about the Ubisoft formula of open-world games.\n\nBut through it all, formulas work because they're comfort food and deliver what is expected while looking darn good and polished doing so, without any fuss. And with a great soundtrack that mixes traditional with contemporary beats & melodies.\n\n[-](https://opencritic.com/outlet/943/le-b-ta-testeur)\n\n**Le Bêta-Testeur**[Gabriel Desrosiers](https://opencritic.com/critic/11067/gabriel-desrosiers)-\n\n*French*-\n\n[9.3 / 10](https://www.lebetatesteur.ca/test-assassins-creed-shadows/)\n\nThis is definitely one of the best games in the franchise. It's a complete game with great improvements, the story is well-constructed, and the player has a lot of freedom in their actions. Without distorting the franchise, I was able to enjoy the game almost as much as the first games. It's not far from equaling Black Flags or the Ezio trilogy.\n\n[-](https://opencritic.com/outlet/948/loot-level-chill)\n\n**Loot Level Chill**[Mick Fraser](https://opencritic.com/critic/572/mick-fraser)-\n\n[9.5 / 10](https://lootlevelchill.com/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\nAssassin's Creed Shadows is an absolute triumph.

With refined combat, breathtaking scenery, captivating characters, and a simple yet very effective storyline, Shadows is undoubtedly an outstanding game. It brings the Japanese setting to life in an excellent way, and I am sure it will earn its place among Ubisoft's greatest games.\n\n[-](https://opencritic.com/outlet/794/mondoxbox)\n\n**MondoXbox**[Giuseppe Genga](https://opencritic.com/critic/7638/giuseppe-genga)-\n\n*Italian*-\n\n[8.8 / 10](https://www.mondoxbox.com/recensione/3737/assassin-s-creed-shadows.html)\n\nAssassin's Creed Shadows succeeds in immersing us in a beautiful medieval Japan, full of activities and missions to be carried out with the character we prefer; the settings, the narrative/cinematic approach, and the stealth gameplay are its strengths, but it's a pity for its too weak connection to the franchise's meta-lore and a sometimes disorienting mission structure. Regardless, if you love the series, action RPGs, or Japanese settings, it is a title not to be missed.\n\n[-](https://opencritic.com/outlet/334/monstervine)\n\n**MonsterVine**[Joe Bariso](https://opencritic.com/critic/7475/joe-bariso)-\n\n[4 / 5](https://monstervine.com/2025/03/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\nWhile not perfect, Assassin’s Creed Shadows is a great ninja simulator and an okay open world game.\n\n[-](https://opencritic.com/outlet/405/new-game-network)\n\n**New Game Network**[Alex Varankou](https://opencritic.com/critic/2669/alex-varankou)-\n\n[74 / 100](https://www.newgamenetwork.com/article/2851/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\nAnother solid entry for the series, Assassin's Creed Shadows offers a wonderfully rendered natural world, though it's not as unique as it once could have been. The typical mix of stealth and action gameplay is still enjoyable and is now split between two protagonists, though switching between them can be cumbersome. Fans of the franchise should be satisfied, if not exactly impressed.\n\n[-](https://opencritic.com/outlet/897/nextplay)\n\n**NextPlay**[Jamie Briggs](https://opencritic.com/critic/10648/jamie-briggs)-\n\n[8 / 10](https://next-play.com.au/assassins-creed-shadows-review-dont-lose-your-head/)\n\nAssassin’s Creed Shadows is a great entry in the Assassin’s Creed franchise and a perfect entry point for newcomers. Its dual protagonists are fantastic and distinct, and while the villains are forgettable, the personal stories of Naoe and Yasuke help deliver a strong narrative. Shadows is visually stunning, with excellent cinematography, beautiful open world, a unique soundtrack and immersive sound design. However, a sparse open world, inconsistent parkour, and a disappointing hideout system, ultimately keep it from reaching true greatness.\n\n**\n**\n\nLast edited:"

The setting is breathtaking, the variety in the missions is great and the gameplay feels very well thought out. The interaction between Yasuke and Naoe in particular creates an interesting dynamic. While Yasuke excels in combat, Naoe offers probably the best parcours gameplay the series has ever had. Traversal with Yasuke, the actual story and the typical open-world problems do tarnish the whole thing somewhat, but the series certainly wasn't this good for a while.\\n\\n[-](https://opencritic.com/outlet/563/checkpoint-gaming)\\n\\n**Checkpoint Gaming**[Edie W-K](https://opencritic.com/critic/6031/edie-w-k)-\\n\\n[9 / 10](https://checkpointgaming.net/reviews/2025/03/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\\n\\nAssassin's Creed Shadows is another notch in the belt of this illustrious series. Sneaking and stabbing as Naoe or duelling foes in honourable combat as Yasuke, the duel protagonists are a genius addition to all the things we love about Assassin's Creed. Even though I haven't gelled with the more recent huge open-world AC titles, I leave my time with Assassin's Creed Shadows with renewed excitement for the series thanks to a more manageable map size and a great story.

Assassin's Creed Shadows makes the most of that theme, with a great pair of shinobi and samurai heroes sharing center stage that are well-written and fun to skulk through giant castles or wade into vicious battles with. Besides the setting, the bulk of the changes this time focus on making smaller tweaks to well-established systems, such as less cluttered maps and skill trees, while also doubling down on things that really worked in 2023’s Assassin’s Creed Mirage, like the more focused and tougher combat that accompanies its better paced main quests. It’s not a perfect reset, as imbalances and missed opportunities abound, but I feel more confident than ever that Assassin’s Creed could be back and here to stay.\n\nLike a river in the rainy season, Shadows’ story overflows with cliches that are signature to fiction set in this era. Warriors wander the land to bring honor to themselves and their masters. Absent rulers let wealthy bureaucrats exploit the poor. Bandits hold the countryside in the cold grip of fear. If you’re a fan of James Clavell’s Shogun or the excellent movies of Akira Kurosawa, you have certainly seen the bulk of what protagonists Yasuke and Naoe are made to navigate. This isn’t a bad thing, and morally complex intersecting plots still keep the intrigue high, which is the same trick that made Assassin’s Creed Valhalla’s stories work when they did. I don’t think I was particularly wowed by the writing on a regular basis, but there are some standout moments of tense reflection and curious happenings sprinkled throughout. The typical Assassin’s Creed conspiracy woven into it fits perfectly within the war torn Sengoku period of Japan, too, like a hidden blade snugly in its wrist sheath.\n\nThe leads themselves are wonderful. You spend a lot of the early game with the sharp-witted and broody Naoe, who is among the last shinobi warriors of the Iga clan, a role thrust upon her by tragedy. That tragedy befell her in part by the hands of the charismatic hulk Yasuke, who is a tireless warrior for justice and peace. When they begin working together, they are frequently each other’s most reliable consul, with sound and often different perspectives on the events going on around them. In other words, they truly do balance one another, and while I don’t think either one would win popularity contests against other series stars like Ezio or Edward, together they serve as the bright light in the center of a largely dark tale of revenge.\n\nThe story overall is paced similarly to Valhalla, where the cardinal reason to be in each of the nine regions of the map is to play through a mostly self-contained chapter. That said, Shadows does a better job of making sure at least some story elements and characters don’t just completely vanish when you leave a region the way they did in its predecessor. Not every new lord or business man you meet becomes completely irrelevant after you’ve solved their problems. I also found these sections, and the overall time it took to move from chapter to chapter, to be more brisk and less filled with frustrating filler than past games. It’s still a bit too full of “go here, do that” as bridges between major moments than I’d prefer, but it's organized in a way that can be enjoyed in pieces and at your leisure without getting too lost between plot points, almost like how one might read a good book.\n\nMost of the missions in Shadows start on the objective board, a bigger and more elaborate chart of people that need assistance and targets that need eliminating adapted from Assassin’s Creed Mirage. Thematically, this approach matches the tone of using all the information you gather to identify hidden members of the secret society trying to plunge Japan into chaos. Functionally, the way it organizes outstanding tasks and the people involved is far more useful than the old bulleted quest lists. It does trade some of the magic of exploration away as a cost of this efficacy, though. More than once I organically stumbled across a jerk that couldn’t be talked down, just to kill them and find not only his crossed out profile tacked to my board, but also the exact number of remaining silhouettes of the gang I had no idea they were a part of until right then. But it’s a trade I would make every time.\n\nSelecting a quest gave me a short list of clues to help discern where the objective was, which is easier to figure out depending on how well I’d searched that part of the map already. Past games have given hints to identify targets like this before, hoping to create some friction between you and the effort to find your quarry, but Shadows is the first one that I felt constantly made me look at my map and actually deduce where the spot in question might be by using those clues and some educated guesses. I could use scouts, one of the assets you can develop at your hideout, to assist in the narrowing process, pinging an area on the map and highlighting unidentified objectives in the zone. This doesn't reveal hidden locations or features of the map outside of just a marker though, so it's a bad way to clear fog of war from a distance. It will also cost one scout whether they find something or not, and scouts are replenished in very few ways, so scouting can be a real risk if you’re trying to make progress in the main story – especially early on.\n\nRather than lighting up your map with a galaxy of tooltips, Shadows mostly relies on sparse point-of-interest icons to push you towards the areas you’ll need to see the finer details of in-person. Even when you climb up to the signature highpoints to take a good long look at your surroundings, what you’ll see is a bevy of nondescript icons that tell you that *something *is out there, but you’re gonna have to hop down from that perch and go check them out for yourself to know what. I love this – I could feel my brain starting to detangle the checklist conditioning that years of these games had instilled in me. Not only did I feel compelled to just ride through the countryside and genuinely explore stuff without much expectation of grand rewards, I also felt no nagging compulsion to check off every possible thing to do in a region inorganically.\n\nMost of these undiscovered locations fall into one of a number of reliable categories, like castles you can infiltrate and attempt to steal special gear from or any of the many villages scattered across Japan, but you can’t be sure unless you take it in for yourself. A common thing I would always stop to handle whenever I came across them were world activities – these are smaller locations and events that, when completed, add knowledge points to your characters, increasing their knowledge levels and adding new options to their skill trees. Not all of these events are exciting, with running around temples to find missing scroll pages being my least favorite, but they often don’t take too long and the points are worth it in the end. And in the case of something like the horse archery challenges, they can add an interesting distraction from the action for a short spell.\n\nBetween outings, I spent some time at the hideout, this iteration of Valhalla’s Ravensthorpe settlement. After collecting minerals, crops, and wood out in the world, you can use those resources to build and upgrade important buildings here that give you access to new assets. I spent the majority of my time at the forge managing my equipment, while other important buildings provide more passive additions or have features that can be managed in places outside of the hideout, like the new summoning ability from the dojo which let me call in help from certain allies I met during my adventure. I’m glad I didn’t have to dote on this place very much as I personally can’t be bothered to decorate a homestead, but for those interested in that sort of thing I was absolutely flooded by the cosmetics I unlocked just in the natural course of completing tasks and looting, so you’ll never be starved for options to spice the place up.\n\nThe real sightseeing, though, is out in the world. 1500s Japan is a beautiful place – there’s such a symphony of color over every hill and across every lake. Each season brings with it incredible landscapes, sometimes covered in the reddish brown of Autumn or entombed in deep white snow. In fact, I found the weather to be some of the best I’d ever experienced in an open world. It was hard not to be moved watching powerful winds pick up and bring in rolling thunderstorms, especially when watching how nature reacted to it all in real time, as flocks of birds took flight and ground critters scurry around to find safety. And not for nothing, but in my dozens of hours in Shadows I encountered remarkably few bugs for a game this size.\n\nThe main 40-hour story revolves around the dual protagonists attempting to unmask and eliminate members of a deadly organization called the Shinbakufu. Once you’ve chosen a target, the multi-mission arcs give you regular opportunities to handle a situation with either Yasuke’s might or Naoe’s stealth. However, while there are certainly scenarios where one is more useful than the other, in general, there are remarkably few quests where Naoe isn’t better suited for the task at hand. This comes down to how their abilities are divided between them. If the classic Assassin’s Creed playstyle is the combination of exploration, parkour, stealth, and combat, Naoe can do all of these competently and excels at parkour and stealth. Yasuke, meanwhile, can’t climb very well or sneak around much due to his size and general lack of grace. He is a devastating force in combat – maybe the most overbearing and dominant protagonist in the series – but Naoe can simply sneak around most situations that Yasuke would cut his way through, solving them with so much less trouble if done well. As much as I like Yasuke, he’s far more limited and one dimensional in his style, with large parts of this game not quite designed to take advantage of his strengths in a way that feels intentional.\n\nIt's particularly disappointing because Shadows does find ways to tailor missions around both of their skills on occasion, usually in bigger, more pivotal and important battles where both heroes need to operate together to succeed. These special missions are separated into sections that allow you to choose which character to proceed with, changing what’s asked of you depending on your choice. In a later game mission, Naoe is securing the perimeter of the castle walls, taking out gunmen, while Yasuke storms the place demanding to challenge this chapter’s foe to a duel for the lives of his hostages. Depending on who you play as, you’re either weaving through blockades to drop specific soldiers without alerting the whole castle, or you’re having a fierce duel against a powerful samurai. It's awesome, and made the more homogenous space between these moments a real bummer.\n\nCombat overall is more challenging than in the past. Enemies, especially in groups, are more aggressive, relying on combos and unblockable attacks as often as possible. They also tend to have solid defenses, both in that they block a lot and also in that many of them are armored, essentially giving them a second life bar. Effectively taking them down means having a solid defense of your own, dodging and deflecting their blows to make them vulnerable, and taking advantage before they recover. It requires a more thoughtful execution of your various abilities than previous games have, and I never felt like combat was a chore in and of itself – though the camera really struggled to keep all of the action in frame, and doubly so when inside buildings.\n\nStraightforward combat really sings when playing as Yasuke, whose set of swords, naginata, kanabo, bows, and even guns are all perfect for decimating enemies. He is a juggernaut of a man outside of his toys, being able to literally run through walls and shake the earth with his blows. He’s also tough and can take many more blows before succumbing to his wounds. Naoe is very fragile by comparison, and while capable of doing lots of damage when enemies are vulnerable, she struggles to stagger them without the help of her tools. She gets overwhelmed easily by mobs, especially well-armored bruisers, and when the numbers get above three or four foes, I almost always found it better to drop a smoke bomb and disappear versus attempting to fight them all in an open melee.\n\nOn the flipside, Naoe is a menace when striking from the shadows or catching enemies unaware. This Assassin’s Creed takes the “Shadows” in its name seriously, with darkness being a key part of her stealth gameplan. There are some new features that help her out, like being able to crawl and dodge while prone, as well as some returning ones like her Eagle Sense, which lets you see silhouettes of enemies through walls. The long-missing double assassination is back too, and all of these add up to make Naoe one of the most robust assassins in the series. Yasuke can’t hold a candle to his ninja counterpart in this arena.\n\nEnhancing your combat abilities is mercifully less tedious than Valhalla’s skill constellation. Naoe and Yasuke have skill trees focused on their weapons and specialities, with every node feeling far more impactful than simple passive damage bonuses (which still exist, but in small amounts). Gaining new abilities is obviously the most impactful, but some of the real hidden gems add new functionality to weapons, like being able to turn certain attacks with Naoe’s chain sickle into grapples that let you pull enemies into obstacles or off of cliffs. Yasuke and his abundance of weapons made for some skill trees I largely ignored, especially his bow and teppo, as he is such a close ranged juggernaut that I had a hard time justifying spending my admittedly plentiful skill points on a ranged strategy I never embraced.\n\nSpeaking of excess, Shadows takes a big step backward from the work done around your inventory in Valhalla and Mirage. There are far too many pieces of randomized, color-tiered gear to pick up from fallen foes or as forgettable quest rewards that have no chance of making it into my rotation. Base stats like damage might make them relevant as last-minute stop gaps to keep your stats in line with bad guys at your level, but only until you find that next piece of legendary gear or earn enough resources to level up a piece you already like. The skills on legendary gear, like a kanabo that turns enemies into shrapnel grenades when you break their armor, are impactful in a way that the generic percentage buffs to XYZ skill that you get from the lower tiers of gear never even come close to."

It\\u2019s not a perfect reset, as imbalances and missed opportunities abound, but I feel more confident than ever that Assassin\\u2019s Creed could be back and here to stay.\\n\\nLike a river in the rainy season, Shadows\\u2019 story overflows with cliches that are signature to fiction set in this era. Warriors wander the land to bring honor to themselves and their masters. Absent rulers let wealthy bureaucrats exploit the poor. Bandits hold the countryside in the cold grip of fear. If you\\u2019re a fan of James Clavell\\u2019s Shogun or the excellent movies of Akira Kurosawa, you have certainly seen the bulk of what protagonists Yasuke and Naoe are made to navigate. This isn\\u2019t a bad thing, and morally complex intersecting plots still keep the intrigue high, which is the same trick that made Assassin\\u2019s Creed Valhalla\\u2019s stories work when they did. I don\\u2019t think I was particularly wowed by the writing on a regular basis, but there are some standout moments of tense reflection and curious happenings sprinkled throughout. The typical Assassin\\u2019s Creed conspiracy woven into it fits perfectly within the war torn Sengoku period of Japan, too, like a hidden blade snugly in its wrist sheath.\\n\\nThe leads themselves are wonderful. You spend a lot of the early game with the sharp-witted and broody Naoe, who is among the last shinobi warriors of the Iga clan, a role thrust upon her by tragedy. That tragedy befell her in part by the hands of the charismatic hulk Yasuke, who is a tireless warrior for justice and peace. When they begin working together, they are frequently each other\\u2019s most reliable consul, with sound and often different perspectives on the events going on around them. In other words, they truly do balance one another, and while I don\\u2019t think either one would win popularity contests against other series stars like Ezio or Edward, together they serve as the bright light in the center of a largely dark tale of revenge.\\n\\nThe story overall is paced similarly to Valhalla, where the cardinal reason to be in each of the nine regions of the map is to play through a mostly self-contained chapter. That said, Shadows does a better job of making sure at least some story elements and characters don\\u2019t just completely vanish when you leave a region the way they did in its predecessor. Not every new lord or business man you meet becomes completely irrelevant after you\\u2019ve solved their problems. I also found these sections, and the overall time it took to move from chapter to chapter, to be more brisk and less filled with frustrating filler than past games. It\\u2019s still a bit too full of \\u201cgo here, do that\\u201d as bridges between major moments than I\\u2019d prefer, but it's organized in a way that can be enjoyed in pieces and at your leisure without getting too lost between plot points, almost like how one might read a good book.\\n\\nMost of the missions in Shadows start on the objective board, a bigger and more elaborate chart of people that need assistance and targets that need eliminating adapted from Assassin\\u2019s Creed Mirage. Thematically, this approach matches the tone of using all the information you gather to identify hidden members of the secret society trying to plunge Japan into chaos. Functionally, the way it organizes outstanding tasks and the people involved is far more useful than the old bulleted quest lists. It does trade some of the magic of exploration away as a cost of this efficacy, though. More than once I organically stumbled across a jerk that couldn\\u2019t be talked down, just to kill them and find not only his crossed out profile tacked to my board, but also the exact number of remaining silhouettes of the gang I had no idea they were a part of until right then. But it\\u2019s a trade I would make every time.\\n\\nSelecting a quest gave me a short list of clues to help discern where the objective was, which is easier to figure out depending on how well I\\u2019d searched that part of the map already. Past games have given hints to identify targets like this before, hoping to create some friction between you and the effort to find your quarry, but Shadows is the first one that I felt constantly made me look at my map and actually deduce where the spot in question might be by using those clues and some educated guesses. I could use scouts, one of the assets you can develop at your hideout, to assist in the narrowing process, pinging an area on the map and highlighting unidentified objectives in the zone. This doesn't reveal hidden locations or features of the map outside of just a marker though, so it's a bad way to clear fog of war from a distance. It will also cost one scout whether they find something or not, and scouts are replenished in very few ways, so scouting can be a real risk if you\\u2019re trying to make progress in the main story \\u2013 especially early on.\\n\\nRather than lighting up your map with a galaxy of tooltips, Shadows mostly relies on sparse point-of-interest icons to push you towards the areas you\\u2019ll need to see the finer details of in-person. Even when you climb up to the signature highpoints to take a good long look at your surroundings, what you\\u2019ll see is a bevy of nondescript icons that tell you that *something *is out there, but you\\u2019re gonna have to hop down from that perch and go check them out for yourself to know what. I love this \\u2013 I could feel my brain starting to detangle the checklist conditioning that years of these games had instilled in me. Not only did I feel compelled to just ride through the countryside and genuinely explore stuff without much expectation of grand rewards, I also felt no nagging compulsion to check off every possible thing to do in a region inorganically.\\n\\nMost of these undiscovered locations fall into one of a number of reliable categories, like castles you can infiltrate and attempt to steal special gear from or any of the many villages scattered across Japan, but you can\\u2019t be sure unless you take it in for yourself. A common thing I would always stop to handle whenever I came across them were world activities \\u2013 these are smaller locations and events that, when completed, add knowledge points to your characters, increasing their knowledge levels and adding new options to their skill trees. Not all of these events are exciting, with running around temples to find missing scroll pages being my least favorite, but they often don\\u2019t take too long and the points are worth it in the end. And in the case of something like the horse archery challenges, they can add an interesting distraction from the action for a short spell.\\n\\nBetween outings, I spent some time at the hideout, this iteration of Valhalla\\u2019s Ravensthorpe settlement. After collecting minerals, crops, and wood out in the world, you can use those resources to build and upgrade important buildings here that give you access to new assets. I spent the majority of my time at the forge managing my equipment, while other important buildings provide more passive additions or have features that can be managed in places outside of the hideout, like the new summoning ability from the dojo which let me call in help from certain allies I met during my adventure. I\\u2019m glad I didn\\u2019t have to dote on this place very much as I personally can\\u2019t be bothered to decorate a homestead, but for those interested in that sort of thing I was absolutely flooded by the cosmetics I unlocked just in the natural course of completing tasks and looting, so you\\u2019ll never be starved for options to spice the place up.\\n\\nThe real sightseeing, though, is out in the world. 1500s Japan is a beautiful place \\u2013 there\\u2019s such a symphony of color over every hill and across every lake. Each season brings with it incredible landscapes, sometimes covered in the reddish brown of Autumn or entombed in deep white snow. In fact, I found the weather to be some of the best I\\u2019d ever experienced in an open world. It was hard not to be moved watching powerful winds pick up and bring in rolling thunderstorms, especially when watching how nature reacted to it all in real time, as flocks of birds took flight and ground critters scurry around to find safety. And not for nothing, but in my dozens of hours in Shadows I encountered remarkably few bugs for a game this size.\\n\\nThe main 40-hour story revolves around the dual protagonists attempting to unmask and eliminate members of a deadly organization called the Shinbakufu. Once you\\u2019ve chosen a target, the multi-mission arcs give you regular opportunities to handle a situation with either Yasuke\\u2019s might or Naoe\\u2019s stealth. However, while there are certainly scenarios where one is more useful than the other, in general, there are remarkably few quests where Naoe isn\\u2019t better suited for the task at hand. This comes down to how their abilities are divided between them. If the classic Assassin\\u2019s Creed playstyle is the combination of exploration, parkour, stealth, and combat, Naoe can do all of these competently and excels at parkour and stealth. Yasuke, meanwhile, can\\u2019t climb very well or sneak around much due to his size and general lack of grace. He is a devastating force in combat \\u2013 maybe the most overbearing and dominant protagonist in the series \\u2013 but Naoe can simply sneak around most situations that Yasuke would cut his way through, solving them with so much less trouble if done well. As much as I like Yasuke, he\\u2019s far more limited and one dimensional in his style, with large parts of this game not quite designed to take advantage of his strengths in a way that feels intentional.\\n\\nIt's particularly disappointing because Shadows does find ways to tailor missions around both of their skills on occasion, usually in bigger, more pivotal and important battles where both heroes need to operate together to succeed. These special missions are separated into sections that allow you to choose which character to proceed with, changing what\\u2019s asked of you depending on your choice. In a later game mission, Naoe is securing the perimeter of the castle walls, taking out gunmen, while Yasuke storms the place demanding to challenge this chapter\\u2019s foe to a duel for the lives of his hostages. Depending on who you play as, you\\u2019re either weaving through blockades to drop specific soldiers without alerting the whole castle, or you\\u2019re having a fierce duel against a powerful samurai. It's awesome, and made the more homogenous space between these moments a real bummer.\\n\\nCombat overall is more challenging than in the past. Enemies, especially in groups, are more aggressive, relying on combos and unblockable attacks as often as possible. They also tend to have solid defenses, both in that they block a lot and also in that many of them are armored, essentially giving them a second life bar. Effectively taking them down means having a solid defense of your own, dodging and deflecting their blows to make them vulnerable, and taking advantage before they recover. It requires a more thoughtful execution of your various abilities than previous games have, and I never felt like combat was a chore in and of itself \\u2013 though the camera really struggled to keep all of the action in frame, and doubly so when inside buildings.\\n\\nStraightforward combat really sings when playing as Yasuke, whose set of swords, naginata, kanabo, bows, and even guns are all perfect for decimating enemies. He is a juggernaut of a man outside of his toys, being able to literally run through walls and shake the earth with his blows. He\\u2019s also tough and can take many more blows before succumbing to his wounds. Naoe is very fragile by comparison, and while capable of doing lots of damage when enemies are vulnerable, she struggles to stagger them without the help of her tools. She gets overwhelmed easily by mobs, especially well-armored bruisers, and when the numbers get above three or four foes, I almost always found it better to drop a smoke bomb and disappear versus attempting to fight them all in an open melee.\\n\\nOn the flipside, Naoe is a menace when striking from the shadows or catching enemies unaware. This Assassin\\u2019s Creed takes the \\u201cShadows\\u201d in its name seriously, with darkness being a key part of her stealth gameplan. There are some new features that help her out, like being able to crawl and dodge while prone, as well as some returning ones like her Eagle Sense, which lets you see silhouettes of enemies through walls. The long-missing double assassination is back too, and all of these add up to make Naoe one of the most robust assassins in the series. Yasuke can\\u2019t hold a candle to his ninja counterpart in this arena.\\n\\nEnhancing your combat abilities is mercifully less tedious than Valhalla\\u2019s skill constellation. Naoe and Yasuke have skill trees focused on their weapons and specialities, with every node feeling far more impactful than simple passive damage bonuses (which still exist, but in small amounts). Gaining new abilities is obviously the most impactful, but some of the real hidden gems add new functionality to weapons, like being able to turn certain attacks with Naoe\\u2019s chain sickle into grapples that let you pull enemies into obstacles or off of cliffs. Yasuke and his abundance of weapons made for some skill trees I largely ignored, especially his bow and teppo, as he is such a close ranged juggernaut that I had a hard time justifying spending my admittedly plentiful skill points on a ranged strategy I never embraced.\\n\\nSpeaking of excess, Shadows takes a big step backward from the work done around your inventory in Valhalla and Mirage. There are far too many pieces of randomized, color-tiered gear to pick up from fallen foes or as forgettable quest rewards that have no chance of making it into my rotation. Base stats like damage might make them relevant as last-minute stop gaps to keep your stats in line with bad guys at your level, but only until you find that next piece of legendary gear or earn enough resources to level up a piece you already like. The skills on legendary gear, like a kanabo that turns enemies into shrapnel grenades when you break their armor, are impactful in a way that the generic percentage buffs to XYZ skill that you get from the lower tiers of gear never even come close to.\"}",

Shadows is the most refined, balanced, and impeccably produced game in the long-running franchise. As Yasuke the Samurai and Naoe the Shinobi, you\\u2019ll help the people and fight the tyrants while shaping Japan\\u2019s future. The delays were worth it; Ubisoft Montreal has crafted an epic tale.\\n\\n## Naoe & Yasuke\\n\\nFeaturing dual protagonists, Assassin\\u2019s Creed Shadows allows you to play the way you want the majority of the time. To begin, you will switch between Yasuke and Naoe as the story demands. After a few hours, it\\u2019s all Naoe all the time until you progress deep enough into the story for Yasuke to re-enter the fray. From that point on, you can choose who you want to play as outside of a few major story missions, which will show you both of their perspectives.\\n\\nNaoe is a shinobi from the Iga region. Her gameplay features the classic AC style full of parkour, stealth, and assassinations. She is far and away the greatest athlete the series has ever seen. Standing roughly five feet tall, her agility and speed feel amazing to control. My wife laughed at her over-the-top acrobatics as she did full Olympic gymnast dismounts from any decent height.\\n\\nYasuke is known as \\u201cThe Giant\\u201d throughout the land. Standing an imposing (at the time) 6 feet tall, with broad shoulders, he fights like the brutes from past titles. While Naoe\\u2019s stealth is good fun, Yasuke\\u2019s brute force will make you feel like a monster. He can climb a bit, though finding most eagle perch synchronization spots will require Naoe\\u2019s grappling hook and skills. I highly recommend doing leaps of faith, another series staple, with Yasuke. He\\u2019s so damned big and heavy in his armor that, well you should see for yourself.\\n\\n## Feudal Japan\\n\\nAs amazing as the characters, story, gameplay, and music are, the star of the game is the world. Back at Gamescom 2024, I got to see a behind-closed-doors presentation on the improvements made to the Anvil engine. Wind, leaves, particulate- it\\u2019s all real, and it has spoiled other games.\\n\\nIt is a country of rough weather with distinct seasons. The Anvil Engine handles all of it beautifully, with heavy winds blowing leaves of all different shades around and rain cascading off of roofs as it builds up on your character. I mostly played on GeForce Now to start with before shifting to Xbox Series X & PC once those builds were ready. No matter where I played the game, it looked and ran well, feeling extremely polished and well optimized.\\n\\nXbox Series X Quality (30fps) and Balanced (40fps) modes look gorgeous, with the Performance (60fps) mode looking damned good, with some noticeable lighting downgrades. Running maxed out on GeForce Now with a 4080 or my local PC with a 7900xtx, I got a locked 60+ fps at Ultra settings.\\n\\nIt is one of the greatest-looking pieces of media I have ever seen. Feudal Japan is a perfect play space for Ubisoft\\u2019s artists to build a stunningly realized world full of life, color, and danger. Seeing the morning sun shining through the trees, how it properly cascades and shines through various material types, you have to see it.\\n\\nI cannot overstate how amazing the lighting is, and when you add in the physical wind interactivity with grass, bushes, and trees shaking around, it is an astounding technical achievement.\\n\\nAlso, I have to call out how incredible the facial animations are. One of the biggest improvements over passed titles, there are times the characters look completely human, with cutscenes shifting to 30fps on all platforms to up the texture and animation quality to its max level.\\n\\n## ASSASSINO!\\n\\nAll of this brilliant world-building and feel is in service of AC Shadow\\u2019s fantastic gameplay. We\\u2019ll start with Naoe and her Shinobi style. For fans of the series, she is the greatest playing protagonist yet. Her focus is on parrying white and blue-colored incoming strikes and dodging the red-colored ones.\\n\\nYour quick attack is on the right bumper, with heavy on the right trigger. The left bumper is used for parrying, and B is dodge. The left trigger activates your ranged abilities and ally call-ins (more on that later).\\n\\nNaoe has the following melee and ranged options:**Melee**: Katana, Tanto, and Kusarigama**Ranged**: Kunai, Shuriken, Bell, Smoke Bomb\\n\\n**Skill Tree:** Katana, Tanto, Kusarigama, Tools, Assassin, Shinobi\\n\\nAlongside all of this is the classic hidden blade, allowing her to quickly dispatch foes in a single blow as long as the number of health segments she can remove in one attack is more than their health bar. You start with the katana, and while it looks great, she\\u2019s weak in one-on-one fights. I preferred having the tanto out as it allows for dual assassinations, where she\\u2019ll use the short tanto blade and her hidden blade in unison.\\n\\nThe Kusarigama is best for groups of enemies as you swing the heavy spike ball around on its chain while using the sickle for short-range hits. Kunai are heavy throwing daggers that can take out most regular enemies in a single headshot, while the shuriken (ninja stars) are best used in combo with your melee attacks as they are quick but low damage. While the small bell is great for distracting enemies away from a particular location, the greatest tool is the smoke bomb.\\n\\nTossing one of those on the ground at your enemy\\u2019s feet makes them lose track of you, opening things up for an assassination attempt. By the end of the game, my assassinations could take upwards of 7 health segments off, so using these on bosses led to incredibly quick victories.\\n\\n## SAM ARE I\\n\\nYasuke is a wholly different beast. No tools, only weapons, brute force, and heavy armor.\\n\\nYasuke has the following melee and ranged options:**Melee**: Long Katana, Kanabo, Naginata**Ranged**: Long Bow, Teppo (one-shot rifle)**Skill Tree: **Long Katana, Kanabo, Naginata, Long Bow, Teppo, Samurai\\n\\nYasuke has no hidden blade, his only assassination is of the brutal variety. He yells \\u201cI\\u2019m here\\u201d in various ways before chopping his opponent\\u2019s head off, smashing it with a hammer, or chopping both arms off and then the head with the pole sword. He is a vicious combatant who can take far more of a pounding than Naoe, which is good because he\\u2019s not the best at being silent.\\n\\nWhile you begin with the Long Katana, my favorite was the Kanabo. It is an enormous club that Yasuke will use to hit home runs with. Your opponent\\u2019s heads are the balls, and they will go flying. AC Shadows is a violent game, full of body parts being chopped or knocked off, with the most brutal hits turning your enemy\\u2019s domes into a fine red mist.\\n\\n## Skills To Pay The Bills\\n\\nNaoe and Yasuke both have six distinct skill trees and each tree has dozens of nodes with a few active and many passive abilities. You can have two weapons and two active abilities equipped at any time on each. Your skills can be refunded for free whenever you choose, which allowed me to experiment with different playstyles without much fuss.\\n\\nI\\u2019d recommend focusing on Adrenaline chunks, which are used for abilities, and health segments removed on assassination. Every tree has multiple levels, and to unlock these, you\\u2019ll need to complete various tasks given red icons across the map. These can be meditation sessions for Naoe, finding lost scrolls in temples, or horseback archery runs with Yasuke. The map has dozens, if not hundreds, of these activities, and I spent a long time on them to get the mind points necessary for unlocking new skills.\\n\\nSome may not appreciate the grind, but as I naturally found more than enough side activities throughout the main story, I think it is well done overall. The map in Assassin\\u2019s Creed Shadows is enormous, spanning a decent chunk of mainland Japan. Utilizing the game\\u2019s various fast travel points, you can hop between areas and find more activities without issue, and my god, is there a lot to do.\\n\\n## The Quest Board\\n\\nShadows uses a new quest board system that slowly fills up with a series of circular zones or organization-specific quests. At the start of the game, you\\u2019ll have your giant main antagonist collective circle and one for Naoe. As you meet and unlock Yasuke, quests for him will appear. As you enter all of the game\\u2019s dozens of regions and sub-regions, more and more quest circles will be unveiled.\\n\\nBy the time the full credits had rolled and I had played through the epilogue section, I was at roughly 50 hours. If I focused on just the main quest, I doubt I could have properly beaten things on normal difficulty in less than 30. With everything left on my map by the \\u201cend\\u201d and how the story leads to potential new adventures, I could see many having their 100+ hour playtimes like they did in Valhalla.\\n\\nWhere that game suffered, its pacing, Shadows does not. Never once did I feel forced to do side content. I focused on and did it because it was so damned good and/or fun. I didn\\u2019t care if it was \\u201cfetch quest 40\\u201d in nature because of how damned good the game looked, sounded, and played while I was doing it.\\n\\nYasuke and Naoe each have their own horses, and you can bring up a \\u201ctake me here\\u201d guidance line, though there is no \\u201cpress a button to auto travel along it\\u201d anymore. I still had a solid 33% of the map left to explore after the credits rolled, with more areas and the factions within them littering my already enormous quest board.\\n\\nI don\\u2019t know that the number of quests is that much higher than in past games. The layout is, though, and you now always see exactly how much you\\u2019ve completed every time you look to do something new in the game\\u2019s vast, sweeping story.\\n\\n## Shinobi Rising, Revengeance\\n\\nAssassins Creed Shadows allows you two story options to start with: choose your own adventure or canon mode. I did the \\u201cmake your own story choices\\u201d style during my preview and chose to play through the canon version of events for my review. For the RPG fans out there, you will get a surprisingly different version of events, including the potential losses of allies that do not occur in the canon version.\\n\\nAt one point, I had to rescue a friend that I had been working with throughout 10+ missions. There was no warning or timer on the screen; it just said \\u201crescue x\\u201d. I messed up a few jumps and all of a sudden heard a gunshot. My \\u201crescue x\\u201d changed to \\u201cavenge x\\u201d and my heart dropped. I quickly reloaded the last checkpoint to see if I could save them, and lo and behold, I could.\\n\\nWhen I properly executed each jump, I stopped the would-be killer right before his shot hit and saved my ally. From that point on, they were an option to assist me in fights and spent their time with me at our home base (more on that in a bit). Shadow\\u2019s story is full of choices and consequences. How do you choose to react, and what does that mean for the future? Can you forgive, and if so, was it the right decision?\\n\\nI saw that side of things in my preview of the game and admit it\\u2019s not what I come to AC games for. I\\u2019m all for the option to have a canon mode, which let me not worry about fully micro-managing my choices. Thankfully, I lucked out and saved my entire family in AC Odyssey, but I labored over the choices. Here, I was safe to follow Naoe and Yasuke on their path as they found allies, helped the people, and came to terms with their trauma.\\n\\n## There\\u2019s No Place Like Home\\n\\nSpeaking of allies, early on in Naoe\\u2019s story, you\\u2019ll unlock the hideout. This home base is a little homestead builder, full of buildings, paths, decorations, pets, and more to place in it. As you travel the lands, loot chests, complete quests, and visit vendors, you\\u2019ll find hundreds of items to decorate the hideout to match what you want.\\n\\nThe main buildings offer passive benefits like extra scouts, whom you\\u2019ll use to help you find objectives. Without them, you\\u2019re given a main area, sub-region, and subber-sub-region to try and find your target in. Scouts can also take marked resources from inside strongholds, which they\\u2019ll retrieve for you at the end of a season.\\n\\nSeasons change slowly throughout the game, though you can choose to jump to the next one from the map when it\\u2019s close enough. Spring, Fall, Winter, Summer- they\\u2019re all here in various fashions, and they\\u2019ll completely change up the map, clear your local bounties, and refresh your scout supply.\\n\\nOne of the buildings you\\u2019ll unlock is a scout hub, with many of them also dotting each city you visit. For 800 mon (in-game currency), you can unlock them as fast travel and scout/ally hub spots. There are systems on systems, with dojos that let you train up your allies so that they\\u2019re more powerful when you call them in. One of the first allies I found was named Yaya, a giant of a woman. After upgrading her, she\\u2019d run in and choke-slam any poor bastard who dared get in her way.\\n\\nIf you want to get your interior decorator on, then the hunt for new items and the ease with which you can place them should see dozens of hours lost. To build new buildings that give benefits, you\\u2019ll need materials, which are some of the main benefits of looting castles and other various strongholds. Many nights were spent scouring the map for new places to rob from the shadows as Naoe or blast through as Yasuke.\\n\\n## A New \\u2018Do\\n\\nI won\\u2019t get into any story specifics as I like to keep it as spoiler-free as possible. Naoe and Yasuke will travel across various lands with less of a focus on the overarching Assassin vs. Templar narrative than previous games. It is still very much there, and when it comes to the front, it is brilliant. To even get to all this, though, you\\u2019ll have to go through the new AC Nexus launcher.\\n\\nAssassin\\u2019s Creed Shadows is the first game to use this new Animus Hub, where each of the recent titles from Origins to now is available to launch (as long as you own them and they\\u2019re installed). It isn\\u2019t the Call of Duty HQ app, you\\u2019re still loading each game individually. It\\u2019s the front end that does all the work.\\n\\nIn that front end, you\\u2019ll have the Memories (games), any new Animus-focused story segments, a content library, and free in-game reward tracks (battle passes). There are two of the \\u201cbattle passes\\u201d to start with, and to progress along them, you\\u2019ll do daily and weekly in-game quests to gain keys. These keys get you items, and there is already a full microtransaction store that gets you level-appropriate gear with incredibly over-the-top looks.\\n\\nWithout spending a penny, I had enough in-game mtx money to buy a few items and had progressed a decent way through the first \\u201cbattle pass\\u201d. I\\u2019m sure people will be furious about it for a week or two, but this system is nothing new and not nearly as egregious as the one they tried way back with Unity.\\n\\n## Feudal Funk\\n\\nFinally, I\\u2019d like to talk about the game\\u2019s vibes. It is feudal Japan, full of nanban like the Portuguese who are slowly trying to dominate the region. As the slave Diogo, you\\u2019ll fight against this to become the samurai Yasuke. Ubisoft Montreal never hold back from calling Yasuke what he is, the respect he commands, nor do they shy away from his terrible past.\\n\\nNaoe is a young woman at the start, living with her father in a small village a few years after her mother\\u2019s death. Finding out what happened to her, who her father truly is (she gets a hidden blade for a reason!), and where her tale takes her is a delight. The friendship she forms with Yasuke feels natural, at least in the canon mode, and the way the story leaves off ties up every main question I had while offering up intriguing new ones for future content in this stunningly realized world.\\n\\nThe music is a blend of classical tunes and full location-appropriate instruments without ever feeling like a parody. Funky fight music carries battles while sweeping tracks add to the grandeur of every vista. There is a canon voice mode as well, featuring the correct languages for each character, mainly Japanese and Portuguese, as needed. I used this for most of my playthrough, opting for English when my eyes grew tired from reading subtitles. The canon voice acting is excellent, while the English voice acting has a generally high level with the occasional off-performance.\\n\\nI was completely satisfied with the game\\u2019s story and how it ended. Things aren\\u2019t wrapped up with a neat bow, and I fully expect a lot more content in the future starring these characters. Whether it\\u2019s only expansions or full sequels, I cannot wait to head back to Japan to continue this league\\u2019s expertly crafted journey.\\n\\n## Wrapping Things Up\\n\\nThere\\u2019s so much more I could talk about but\\u2026 [spoilers](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/assassins-creed-shadows/9NRRMKB49KQP). Assassin\\u2019s Creed: Shadows is the best entry in the series. There is no area in which it is lacking, with expert pacing despite its enormous size. Naoe and Yasuke shine as dual protagonists, as does Japan itself. This one has been my favorite in a year of amazing releases.\\n\\n### Assassin's Creed Shadows\\n\\n###### Played on\\n\\n##### Xbox Series X (main) & PC\\n\\n#### PROS\\n\\n- A Living, Breathing World\\n- Excellent Story\\n- Fantastic Gameplay\\n- Gorgeous Soundtrack\\n- Just Damned Cool\\n\\n#### CONS\\n\\n- A few of the English VOs are Weak\"}",

Naoe and Yasuke are my definitive heroes for this series, two individuals who are wonderfully portrayed by their respective actors, and the talented team that brought them to life.\\n\\n[-](https://opencritic.com/outlet/885/atarita)\\n\\n**Atarita**[Alparslan G\\u00fcrlek](https://opencritic.com/critic/7536/alparslan-g-rlek)-\\n\\n*Turkish*-\\n\\n[84 / 100](https://www.atarita.com/assassins-creed-shadows-inceleme/)\\n\\nAssassin's Creed Shadows has taken a long-overdue step forward with its new mechanics and technical improvements.

The setting is breathtaking, the variety in the missions is great and the gameplay feels very well thought out. The interaction between Yasuke and Naoe in particular creates an interesting dynamic. While Yasuke excels in combat, Naoe offers probably the best parcours gameplay the series has ever had. Traversal with Yasuke, the actual story and the typical open-world problems do tarnish the whole thing somewhat, but the series certainly wasn't this good for a while.\\n\\n[-](https://opencritic.com/outlet/563/checkpoint-gaming)\\n\\n**Checkpoint Gaming**[Edie W-K](https://opencritic.com/critic/6031/edie-w-k)-\\n\\n[9 / 10](https://checkpointgaming.net/reviews/2025/03/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\\n\\nAssassin's Creed Shadows is another notch in the belt of this illustrious series. Sneaking and stabbing as Naoe or duelling foes in honourable combat as Yasuke, the duel protagonists are a genius addition to all the things we love about Assassin's Creed. Even though I haven't gelled with the more recent huge open-world AC titles, I leave my time with Assassin's Creed Shadows with renewed excitement for the series thanks to a more manageable map size and a great story.

Whether you\\u2019re looking to explore the stunning world of feudal Japan, storm the gates of an enemy castle, or fall in love with the many NPCs that populate its world, Assassin's Creed Shadows is an immersive treat that cements itself as the best Assassin's Creed game since Black Flag.\\n\\n[-](https://opencritic.com/outlet/944/digitale-anime)\\n\\n**Digitale Anime**[Raouf Belhamra](https://opencritic.com/critic/11073/raouf-belhamra)-\\n\\n*Arabic*-\\n\\n[9 / 10](https://ar.digitaleanime.dz/archives/63927)\\n\\n\\\"A worthy heir to a venerable lineage\\\" Assassin's Creed Shadows offers one of the most distinctive stealth and infiltration experiences in the series, thanks to its dual-hero system and richly detailed world.

Assassin's Creed Shadows makes the most of that theme, with a great pair of shinobi and samurai heroes sharing center stage that are well-written and fun to skulk through giant castles or wade into vicious battles with. Besides the setting, the bulk of the changes this time focus on making smaller tweaks to well-established systems, such as less cluttered maps and skill trees, while also doubling down on things that really worked in 2023\\u2019s Assassin\\u2019s Creed Mirage, like the more focused and tougher combat that accompanies its better paced main quests. It\\u2019s not a perfect reset, as imbalances and missed opportunities abound, but I feel more confident than ever that Assassin\\u2019s Creed could be back and here to stay.\\n\\nLike a river in the rainy season, Shadows\\u2019 story overflows with cliches that are signature to fiction set in this era. Warriors wander the land to bring honor to themselves and their masters. Absent rulers let wealthy bureaucrats exploit the poor. Bandits hold the countryside in the cold grip of fear. If you\\u2019re a fan of James Clavell\\u2019s Shogun or the excellent movies of Akira Kurosawa, you have certainly seen the bulk of what protagonists Yasuke and Naoe are made to navigate. This isn\\u2019t a bad thing, and morally complex intersecting plots still keep the intrigue high, which is the same trick that made Assassin\\u2019s Creed Valhalla\\u2019s stories work when they did. I don\\u2019t think I was particularly wowed by the writing on a regular basis, but there are some standout moments of tense reflection and curious happenings sprinkled throughout. The typical Assassin\\u2019s Creed conspiracy woven into it fits perfectly within the war torn Sengoku period of Japan, too, like a hidden blade snugly in its wrist sheath.\\n\\nThe leads themselves are wonderful. You spend a lot of the early game with the sharp-witted and broody Naoe, who is among the last shinobi warriors of the Iga clan, a role thrust upon her by tragedy. That tragedy befell her in part by the hands of the charismatic hulk Yasuke, who is a tireless warrior for justice and peace. When they begin working together, they are frequently each other\\u2019s most reliable consul, with sound and often different perspectives on the events going on around them. In other words, they truly do balance one another, and while I don\\u2019t think either one would win popularity contests against other series stars like Ezio or Edward, together they serve as the bright light in the center of a largely dark tale of revenge.\\n\\nThe story overall is paced similarly to Valhalla, where the cardinal reason to be in each of the nine regions of the map is to play through a mostly self-contained chapter. That said, Shadows does a better job of making sure at least some story elements and characters don\\u2019t just completely vanish when you leave a region the way they did in its predecessor. Not every new lord or business man you meet becomes completely irrelevant after you\\u2019ve solved their problems. I also found these sections, and the overall time it took to move from chapter to chapter, to be more brisk and less filled with frustrating filler than past games. It\\u2019s still a bit too full of \\u201cgo here, do that\\u201d as bridges between major moments than I\\u2019d prefer, but it's organized in a way that can be enjoyed in pieces and at your leisure without getting too lost between plot points, almost like how one might read a good book.\\n\\nMost of the missions in Shadows start on the objective board, a bigger and more elaborate chart of people that need assistance and targets that need eliminating adapted from Assassin\\u2019s Creed Mirage. Thematically, this approach matches the tone of using all the information you gather to identify hidden members of the secret society trying to plunge Japan into chaos. Functionally, the way it organizes outstanding tasks and the people involved is far more useful than the old bulleted quest lists. It does trade some of the magic of exploration away as a cost of this efficacy, though. More than once I organically stumbled across a jerk that couldn\\u2019t be talked down, just to kill them and find not only his crossed out profile tacked to my board, but also the exact number of remaining silhouettes of the gang I had no idea they were a part of until right then. But it\\u2019s a trade I would make every time.\\n\\nSelecting a quest gave me a short list of clues to help discern where the objective was, which is easier to figure out depending on how well I\\u2019d searched that part of the map already. Past games have given hints to identify targets like this before, hoping to create some friction between you and the effort to find your quarry, but Shadows is the first one that I felt constantly made me look at my map and actually deduce where the spot in question might be by using those clues and some educated guesses. I could use scouts, one of the assets you can develop at your hideout, to assist in the narrowing process, pinging an area on the map and highlighting unidentified objectives in the zone. This doesn't reveal hidden locations or features of the map outside of just a marker though, so it's a bad way to clear fog of war from a distance. It will also cost one scout whether they find something or not, and scouts are replenished in very few ways, so scouting can be a real risk if you\\u2019re trying to make progress in the main story \\u2013 especially early on.\\n\\nRather than lighting up your map with a galaxy of tooltips, Shadows mostly relies on sparse point-of-interest icons to push you towards the areas you\\u2019ll need to see the finer details of in-person. Even when you climb up to the signature highpoints to take a good long look at your surroundings, what you\\u2019ll see is a bevy of nondescript icons that tell you that *something *is out there, but you\\u2019re gonna have to hop down from that perch and go check them out for yourself to know what. I love this \\u2013 I could feel my brain starting to detangle the checklist conditioning that years of these games had instilled in me. Not only did I feel compelled to just ride through the countryside and genuinely explore stuff without much expectation of grand rewards, I also felt no nagging compulsion to check off every possible thing to do in a region inorganically.\\n\\nMost of these undiscovered locations fall into one of a number of reliable categories, like castles you can infiltrate and attempt to steal special gear from or any of the many villages scattered across Japan, but you can\\u2019t be sure unless you take it in for yourself. A common thing I would always stop to handle whenever I came across them were world activities \\u2013 these are smaller locations and events that, when completed, add knowledge points to your characters, increasing their knowledge levels and adding new options to their skill trees. Not all of these events are exciting, with running around temples to find missing scroll pages being my least favorite, but they often don\\u2019t take too long and the points are worth it in the end. And in the case of something like the horse archery challenges, they can add an interesting distraction from the action for a short spell.\\n\\nBetween outings, I spent some time at the hideout, this iteration of Valhalla\\u2019s Ravensthorpe settlement. After collecting minerals, crops, and wood out in the world, you can use those resources to build and upgrade important buildings here that give you access to new assets. I spent the majority of my time at the forge managing my equipment, while other important buildings provide more passive additions or have features that can be managed in places outside of the hideout, like the new summoning ability from the dojo which let me call in help from certain allies I met during my adventure. I\\u2019m glad I didn\\u2019t have to dote on this place very much as I personally can\\u2019t be bothered to decorate a homestead, but for those interested in that sort of thing I was absolutely flooded by the cosmetics I unlocked just in the natural course of completing tasks and looting, so you\\u2019ll never be starved for options to spice the place up.\\n\\nThe real sightseeing, though, is out in the world. 1500s Japan is a beautiful place \\u2013 there\\u2019s such a symphony of color over every hill and across every lake. Each season brings with it incredible landscapes, sometimes covered in the reddish brown of Autumn or entombed in deep white snow. In fact, I found the weather to be some of the best I\\u2019d ever experienced in an open world. It was hard not to be moved watching powerful winds pick up and bring in rolling thunderstorms, especially when watching how nature reacted to it all in real time, as flocks of birds took flight and ground critters scurry around to find safety. And not for nothing, but in my dozens of hours in Shadows I encountered remarkably few bugs for a game this size.\\n\\nThe main 40-hour story revolves around the dual protagonists attempting to unmask and eliminate members of a deadly organization called the Shinbakufu. Once you\\u2019ve chosen a target, the multi-mission arcs give you regular opportunities to handle a situation with either Yasuke\\u2019s might or Naoe\\u2019s stealth. However, while there are certainly scenarios where one is more useful than the other, in general, there are remarkably few quests where Naoe isn\\u2019t better suited for the task at hand. This comes down to how their abilities are divided between them. If the classic Assassin\\u2019s Creed playstyle is the combination of exploration, parkour, stealth, and combat, Naoe can do all of these competently and excels at parkour and stealth. Yasuke, meanwhile, can\\u2019t climb very well or sneak around much due to his size and general lack of grace. He is a devastating force in combat \\u2013 maybe the most overbearing and dominant protagonist in the series \\u2013 but Naoe can simply sneak around most situations that Yasuke would cut his way through, solving them with so much less trouble if done well. As much as I like Yasuke, he\\u2019s far more limited and one dimensional in his style, with large parts of this game not quite designed to take advantage of his strengths in a way that feels intentional.\\n\\nIt's particularly disappointing because Shadows does find ways to tailor missions around both of their skills on occasion, usually in bigger, more pivotal and important battles where both heroes need to operate together to succeed. These special missions are separated into sections that allow you to choose which character to proceed with, changing what\\u2019s asked of you depending on your choice. In a later game mission, Naoe is securing the perimeter of the castle walls, taking out gunmen, while Yasuke storms the place demanding to challenge this chapter\\u2019s foe to a duel for the lives of his hostages. Depending on who you play as, you\\u2019re either weaving through blockades to drop specific soldiers without alerting the whole castle, or you\\u2019re having a fierce duel against a powerful samurai. It's awesome, and made the more homogenous space between these moments a real bummer.\\n\\nCombat overall is more challenging than in the past. Enemies, especially in groups, are more aggressive, relying on combos and unblockable attacks as often as possible. They also tend to have solid defenses, both in that they block a lot and also in that many of them are armored, essentially giving them a second life bar. Effectively taking them down means having a solid defense of your own, dodging and deflecting their blows to make them vulnerable, and taking advantage before they recover. It requires a more thoughtful execution of your various abilities than previous games have, and I never felt like combat was a chore in and of itself \\u2013 though the camera really struggled to keep all of the action in frame, and doubly so when inside buildings.\\n\\nStraightforward combat really sings when playing as Yasuke, whose set of swords, naginata, kanabo, bows, and even guns are all perfect for decimating enemies. He is a juggernaut of a man outside of his toys, being able to literally run through walls and shake the earth with his blows. He\\u2019s also tough and can take many more blows before succumbing to his wounds. Naoe is very fragile by comparison, and while capable of doing lots of damage when enemies are vulnerable, she struggles to stagger them without the help of her tools. She gets overwhelmed easily by mobs, especially well-armored bruisers, and when the numbers get above three or four foes, I almost always found it better to drop a smoke bomb and disappear versus attempting to fight them all in an open melee.\\n\\nOn the flipside, Naoe is a menace when striking from the shadows or catching enemies unaware. This Assassin\\u2019s Creed takes the \\u201cShadows\\u201d in its name seriously, with darkness being a key part of her stealth gameplan. There are some new features that help her out, like being able to crawl and dodge while prone, as well as some returning ones like her Eagle Sense, which lets you see silhouettes of enemies through walls. The long-missing double assassination is back too, and all of these add up to make Naoe one of the most robust assassins in the series. Yasuke can\\u2019t hold a candle to his ninja counterpart in this arena.\\n\\nEnhancing your combat abilities is mercifully less tedious than Valhalla\\u2019s skill constellation. Naoe and Yasuke have skill trees focused on their weapons and specialities, with every node feeling far more impactful than simple passive damage bonuses (which still exist, but in small amounts). Gaining new abilities is obviously the most impactful, but some of the real hidden gems add new functionality to weapons, like being able to turn certain attacks with Naoe\\u2019s chain sickle into grapples that let you pull enemies into obstacles or off of cliffs. Yasuke and his abundance of weapons made for some skill trees I largely ignored, especially his bow and teppo, as he is such a close ranged juggernaut that I had a hard time justifying spending my admittedly plentiful skill points on a ranged strategy I never embraced.\\n\\nSpeaking of excess, Shadows takes a big step backward from the work done around your inventory in Valhalla and Mirage. There are far too many pieces of randomized, color-tiered gear to pick up from fallen foes or as forgettable quest rewards that have no chance of making it into my rotation. Base stats like damage might make them relevant as last-minute stop gaps to keep your stats in line with bad guys at your level, but only until you find that next piece of legendary gear or earn enough resources to level up a piece you already like. The skills on legendary gear, like a kanabo that turns enemies into shrapnel grenades when you break their armor, are impactful in a way that the generic percentage buffs to XYZ skill that you get from the lower tiers of gear never even come close to.\"}",

[High-profile failures like XDefiant](https://www.thegamer.com/xdefiant-shut-down-ubisoft-san-francisco-osaka-closed/), disappointing sales for games like Star Wars Outlaws, and [mass layoffs across multiple studios](https://www.thegamer.com/ubisoft-closure-studios-layoffs-185-employees/) have all contributed to the narrative that Ubisoft is currently up the creek without a paddle.\\n\\nAssassin's Creed Shadows has the potential to turn its fortunes around though, and [despite all the backlash surrounding Yasuke](https://www.thegamer.com/ubisoft-defends-yasuke-assassins-creed-shadows-controversy/) and [two separate delays](https://www.thegamer.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-march/), it's apparently on course to perform very well. [First reported by Eurogamer](https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-pre-orders-solid-in-line-with-series-second-biggest-launch), Ubisoft claimed in its most recent quarterly earnings call that pre-order sales are currently \\\"solid\\\".\\n\\n## Assassin's Creed Shadows Pre-Order Sales Are Just As Good As Odyssey's\\n\\nExact pre-order numbers were never revealed, but Ubisoft gives us an idea as to just how well Assassin's Creed Shadows is performing before launch by claiming the title is \\\"in line with those of Assassin's Creed Odyssey\\\", which is the second most successful game in the series.\\n\\nAssassin's Creed Valhalla is currently the most successful entry in the series, and it sounds as though that title isn't really under threat from Shadows.\\n\\nOf course, just because a game's pre-order sales are high, doesn't automatically mean it will sell like hotcakes.

Shadows is the most refined, balanced, and impeccably produced game in the long-running franchise. As Yasuke the Samurai and Naoe the Shinobi, you\\\\u0019ll help the people and fight the tyrants while shaping Japan\\\\u0019s future. The delays were worth it; Ubisoft Montreal has crafted an epic tale.\\\\n\\\\n## Naoe & Yasuke\\\\n\\\\nFeaturing dual protagonists, Assassin\\\\u0019s Creed Shadows allows you to play the way you want the majority of the time. To begin, you will switch between Yasuke and Naoe as the story demands. After a few hours, it\\\\u0019s all Naoe all the time until you progress deep enough into the story for Yasuke to re-enter the fray. From that point on, you can choose who you want to play as outside of a few major story missions, which will show you both of their perspectives.\\\\n\\\\nNaoe is a shinobi from the Iga region. Her gameplay features the classic AC style full of parkour, stealth, and assassinations. She is far and away the greatest athlete the series has ever seen. Standing roughly five feet tall, her agility and speed feel amazing to control. My wife laughed at her over-the-top acrobatics as she did full Olympic gymnast dismounts from any decent height.\\\\n\\\\nYasuke is known as \\\\u001cThe Giant\\\\u001d throughout the land. Standing an imposing (at the time) 6 feet tall, with broad shoulders, he fights like the brutes from past titles. While Naoe\\\\u0019s stealth is good fun, Yasuke\\\\u0019s brute force will make you feel like a monster. He can climb a bit, though finding most eagle perch synchronization spots will require Naoe\\\\u0019s grappling hook and skills. I highly recommend doing leaps of faith, another series staple, with Yasuke. He\\\\u0019s so damned big and heavy in his armor that, well you should see for yourself.\\\\n\\\\n## Feudal Japan\\\\n\\\\nAs amazing as the characters, story, gameplay, and music are, the star of the game is the world. Back at Gamescom 2024, I got to see a behind-closed-doors presentation on the improvements made to the Anvil engine. Wind, leaves, particulate- it\\\\u0019s all real, and it has spoiled other games.\\\\n\\\\nIt is a country of rough weather with distinct seasons. The Anvil Engine handles all of it beautifully, with heavy winds blowing leaves of all different shades around and rain cascading off of roofs as it builds up on your character. I mostly played on GeForce Now to start with before shifting to Xbox Series X & PC once those builds were ready. No matter where I played the game, it looked and ran well, feeling extremely polished and well optimized.\\\\n\\\\nXbox Series X Quality (30fps) and Balanced (40fps) modes look gorgeous, with the Performance (60fps) mode looking damned good, with some noticeable lighting downgrades. Running maxed out on GeForce Now with a 4080 or my local PC with a 7900xtx, I got a locked 60+ fps at Ultra settings.\\\\n\\\\nIt is one of the greatest-looking pieces of media I have ever seen. Feudal Japan is a perfect play space for Ubisoft\\\\u0019s artists to build a stunningly realized world full of life, color, and danger. Seeing the morning sun shining through the trees, how it properly cascades and shines through various material types, you have to see it.\\\\n\\\\nI cannot overstate how amazing the lighting is, and when you add in the physical wind interactivity with grass, bushes, and trees shaking around, it is an astounding technical achievement.\\\\n\\\\nAlso, I have to call out how incredible the facial animations are. One of the biggest improvements over passed titles, there are times the characters look completely human, with cutscenes shifting to 30fps on all platforms to up the texture and animation quality to its max level.\\\\n\\\\n## ASSASSINO!\\\\n\\\\nAll of this brilliant world-building and feel is in service of AC Shadow\\\\u0019s fantastic gameplay. We\\\\u0019ll start with Naoe and her Shinobi style. For fans of the series, she is the greatest playing protagonist yet. Her focus is on parrying white and blue-colored incoming strikes and dodging the red-colored ones.\\\\n\\\\nYour quick attack is on the right bumper, with heavy on the right trigger. The left bumper is used for parrying, and B is dodge. The left trigger activates your ranged abilities and ally call-ins (more on that later).\\\\n\\\\nNaoe has the following melee and ranged options:**Melee**: Katana, Tanto, and Kusarigama**Ranged**: Kunai, Shuriken, Bell, Smoke Bomb\\\\n\\\\n**Skill Tree:** Katana, Tanto, Kusarigama, Tools, Assassin, Shinobi\\\\n\\\\nAlongside all of this is the classic hidden blade, allowing her to quickly dispatch foes in a single blow as long as the number of health segments she can remove in one attack is more than their health bar. You start with the katana, and while it looks great, she\\\\u0019s weak in one-on-one fights. I preferred having the tanto out as it allows for dual assassinations, where she\\\\u0019ll use the short tanto blade and her hidden blade in unison.\\\\n\\\\nThe Kusarigama is best for groups of enemies as you swing the heavy spike ball around on its chain while using the sickle for short-range hits. Kunai are heavy throwing daggers that can take out most regular enemies in a single headshot, while the shuriken (ninja stars) are best used in combo with your melee attacks as they are quick but low damage. While the small bell is great for distracting enemies away from a particular location, the greatest tool is the smoke bomb.\\\\n\\\\nTossing one of those on the ground at your enemy\\\\u0019s feet makes them lose track of you, opening things up for an assassination attempt. By the end of the game, my assassinations could take upwards of 7 health segments off, so using these on bosses led to incredibly quick victories.\\\\n\\\\n## SAM ARE I\\\\n\\\\nYasuke is a wholly different beast. No tools, only weapons, brute force, and heavy armor.\\\\n\\\\nYasuke has the following melee and ranged options:**Melee**: Long Katana, Kanabo, Naginata**Ranged**: Long Bow, Teppo (one-shot rifle)**Skill Tree: **Long Katana, Kanabo, Naginata, Long Bow, Teppo, Samurai\\\\n\\\\nYasuke has no hidden blade, his only assassination is of the brutal variety. He yells \\\\u001cI\\\\u0019m here\\\\u001d in various ways before chopping his opponent\\\\u0019s head off, smashing it with a hammer, or chopping both arms off and then the head with the pole sword. He is a vicious combatant who can take far more of a pounding than Naoe, which is good because he\\\\u0019s not the best at being silent.\\\\n\\\\nWhile you begin with the Long Katana, my favorite was the Kanabo. It is an enormous club that Yasuke will use to hit home runs with. Your opponent\\\\u0019s heads are the balls, and they will go flying. AC Shadows is a violent game, full of body parts being chopped or knocked off, with the most brutal hits turning your enemy\\\\u0019s domes into a fine red mist.\\\\n\\\\n## Skills To Pay The Bills\\\\n\\\\nNaoe and Yasuke both have six distinct skill trees and each tree has dozens of nodes with a few active and many passive abilities. You can have two weapons and two active abilities equipped at any time on each. Your skills can be refunded for free whenever you choose, which allowed me to experiment with different playstyles without much fuss.\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\u0019d recommend focusing on Adrenaline chunks, which are used for abilities, and health segments removed on assassination. Every tree has multiple levels, and to unlock these, you\\\\u0019ll need to complete various tasks given red icons across the map. These can be meditation sessions for Naoe, finding lost scrolls in temples, or horseback archery runs with Yasuke. The map has dozens, if not hundreds, of these activities, and I spent a long time on them to get the mind points necessary for unlocking new skills.\\\\n\\\\nSome may not appreciate the grind, but as I naturally found more than enough side activities throughout the main story, I think it is well done overall. The map in Assassin\\\\u0019s Creed Shadows is enormous, spanning a decent chunk of mainland Japan. Utilizing the game\\\\u0019s various fast travel points, you can hop between areas and find more activities without issue, and my god, is there a lot to do.\\\\n\\\\n## The Quest Board\\\\n\\\\nShadows uses a new quest board system that slowly fills up with a series of circular zones or organization-specific quests. At the start of the game, you\\\\u0019ll have your giant main antagonist collective circle and one for Naoe. As you meet and unlock Yasuke, quests for him will appear. As you enter all of the game\\\\u0019s dozens of regions and sub-regions, more and more quest circles will be unveiled.\\\\n\\\\nBy the time the full credits had rolled and I had played through the epilogue section, I was at roughly 50 hours. If I focused on just the main quest, I doubt I could have properly beaten things on normal difficulty in less than 30. With everything left on my map by the \\\\u001cend\\\\u001d and how the story leads to potential new adventures, I could see many having their 100+ hour playtimes like they did in Valhalla.\\\\n\\\\nWhere that game suffered, its pacing, Shadows does not. Never once did I feel forced to do side content. I focused on and did it because it was so damned good and/or fun. I didn\\\\u0019t care if it was \\\\u001cfetch quest 40\\\\u001d in nature because of how damned good the game looked, sounded, and played while I was doing it.\\\\n\\\\nYasuke and Naoe each have their own horses, and you can bring up a \\\\u001ctake me here\\\\u001d guidance line, though there is no \\\\u001cpress a button to auto travel along it\\\\u001d anymore. I still had a solid 33% of the map left to explore after the credits rolled, with more areas and the factions within them littering my already enormous quest board.\\\\n\\\\nI don\\\\u0019t know that the number of quests is that much higher than in past games. The layout is, though, and you now always see exactly how much you\\\\u0019ve completed every time you look to do something new in the game\\\\u0019s vast, sweeping story.\\\\n\\\\n## Shinobi Rising, Revengeance\\\\n\\\\nAssassins Creed Shadows allows you two story options to start with: choose your own adventure or canon mode. I did the \\\\u001cmake your own story choices\\\\u001d style during my preview and chose to play through the canon version of events for my review. For the RPG fans out there, you will get a surprisingly different version of events, including the potential losses of allies that do not occur in the canon version.\\\\n\\\\nAt one point, I had to rescue a friend that I had been working with throughout 10+ missions. There was no warning or timer on the screen; it just said \\\\u001crescue x\\\\u001d. I messed up a few jumps and all of a sudden heard a gunshot. My \\\\u001crescue x\\\\u001d changed to \\\\u001cavenge x\\\\u001d and my heart dropped. I quickly reloaded the last checkpoint to see if I could save them, and lo and behold, I could.\\\\n\\\\nWhen I properly executed each jump, I stopped the would-be killer right before his shot hit and saved my ally. From that point on, they were an option to assist me in fights and spent their time with me at our home base (more on that in a bit). Shadow\\\\u0019s story is full of choices and consequences. How do you choose to react, and what does that mean for the future? Can you forgive, and if so, was it the right decision?\\\\n\\\\nI saw that side of things in my preview of the game and admit it\\\\u0019s not what I come to AC games for. I\\\\u0019m all for the option to have a canon mode, which let me not worry about fully micro-managing my choices. Thankfully, I lucked out and saved my entire family in AC Odyssey, but I labored over the choices. Here, I was safe to follow Naoe and Yasuke on their path as they found allies, helped the people, and came to terms with their trauma.\\\\n\\\\n## There\\\\u0019s No Place Like Home\\\\n\\\\nSpeaking of allies, early on in Naoe\\\\u0019s story, you\\\\u0019ll unlock the hideout. This home base is a little homestead builder, full of buildings, paths, decorations, pets, and more to place in it. As you travel the lands, loot chests, complete quests, and visit vendors, you\\\\u0019ll find hundreds of items to decorate the hideout to match what you want.\\\\n\\\\nThe main buildings offer passive benefits like extra scouts, whom you\\\\u0019ll use to help you find objectives. Without them, you\\\\u0019re given a main area, sub-region, and subber-sub-region to try and find your target in. Scouts can also take marked resources from inside strongholds, which they\\\\u0019ll retrieve for you at the end of a season.\\\\n\\\\nSeasons change slowly throughout the game, though you can choose to jump to the next one from the map when it\\\\u0019s close enough. Spring, Fall, Winter, Summer- they\\\\u0019re all here in various fashions, and they\\\\u0019ll completely change up the map, clear your local bounties, and refresh your scout supply.\\\\n\\\\nOne of the buildings you\\\\u0019ll unlock is a scout hub, with many of them also dotting each city you visit. For 800 mon (in-game currency), you can unlock them as fast travel and scout/ally hub spots. There are systems on systems, with dojos that let you train up your allies so that they\\\\u0019re more powerful when you call them in. One of the first allies I found was named Yaya, a giant of a woman. After upgrading her, she\\\\u0019d run in and choke-slam any poor bastard who dared get in her way.\\\\n\\\\nIf you want to get your interior decorator on, then the hunt for new items and the ease with which you can place them should see dozens of hours lost. To build new buildings that give benefits, you\\\\u0019ll need materials, which are some of the main benefits of looting castles and other various strongholds. Many nights were spent scouring the map for new places to rob from the shadows as Naoe or blast through as Yasuke.\\\\n\\\\n## A New \\\\u0018Do\\\\n\\\\nI won\\\\u0019t get into any story specifics as I like to keep it as spoiler-free as possible. Naoe and Yasuke will travel across various lands with less of a focus on the overarching Assassin vs. Templar narrative than previous games. It is still very much there, and when it comes to the front, it is brilliant. To even get to all this, though, you\\\\u0019ll have to go through the new AC Nexus launcher.\\\\n\\\\nAssassin\\\\u0019s Creed Shadows is the first game to use this new Animus Hub, where each of the recent titles from Origins to now is available to launch (as long as you own them and they\\\\u0019re installed). It isn\\\\u0019t the Call of Duty HQ app, you\\\\u0019re still loading each game individually. It\\\\u0019s the front end that does all the work.\\\\n\\\\nIn that front end, you\\\\u0019ll have the Memories (games), any new Animus-focused story segments, a content library, and free in-game reward tracks (battle passes). There are two of the \\\\u001cbattle passes\\\\u001d to start with, and to progress along them, you\\\\u0019ll do daily and weekly in-game quests to gain keys. These keys get you items, and there is already a full microtransaction store that gets you level-appropriate gear with incredibly over-the-top looks.\\\\n\\\\nWithout spending a penny, I had enough in-game mtx money to buy a few items and had progressed a decent way through the first \\\\u001cbattle pass\\\\u001d. I\\\\u0019m sure people will be furious about it for a week or two, but this system is nothing new and not nearly as egregious as the one they tried way back with Unity.\\\\n\\\\n## Feudal Funk\\\\n\\\\nFinally, I\\\\u0019d like to talk about the game\\\\u0019s vibes. It is feudal Japan, full of nanban like the Portuguese who are slowly trying to dominate the region. As the slave Diogo, you\\\\u0019ll fight against this to become the samurai Yasuke. Ubisoft Montreal never hold back from calling Yasuke what he is, the respect he commands, nor do they shy away from his terrible past.\\\\n\\\\nNaoe is a young woman at the start, living with her father in a small village a few years after her mother\\\\u0019s death. Finding out what happened to her, who her father truly is (she gets a hidden blade for a reason!), and where her tale takes her is a delight. The friendship she forms with Yasuke feels natural, at least in the canon mode, and the way the story leaves off ties up every main question I had while offering up intriguing new ones for future content in this stunningly realized world.\\\\n\\\\nThe music is a blend of classical tunes and full location-appropriate instruments without ever feeling like a parody. Funky fight music carries battles while sweeping tracks add to the grandeur of every vista. There is a canon voice mode as well, featuring the correct languages for each character, mainly Japanese and Portuguese, as needed. I used this for most of my playthrough, opting for English when my eyes grew tired from reading subtitles. The canon voice acting is excellent, while the English voice acting has a generally high level with the occasional off-performance.\\\\n\\\\nI was completely satisfied with the game\\\\u0019s story and how it ended. Things aren\\\\u0019t wrapped up with a neat bow, and I fully expect a lot more content in the future starring these characters. Whether it\\\\u0019s only expansions or full sequels, I cannot wait to head back to Japan to continue this league\\\\u0019s expertly crafted journey.\\\\n\\\\n## Wrapping Things Up\\\\n\\\\nThere\\\\u0019s so much more I could talk about but\\\\u001d [spoilers](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/assassins-creed-shadows/9NRRMKB49KQP). Assassin\\\\u0019s Creed: Shadows is the best entry in the series. There is no area in which it is lacking, with expert pacing despite its enormous size. Naoe and Yasuke shine as dual protagonists, as does Japan itself. This one has been my favorite in a year of amazing releases.\\\\n\\\\n### Assassin's Creed Shadows\\\\n\\\\n###### Played on\\\\n\\\\n##### Xbox Series X (main) & PC\\\\n\\\\n#### PROS\\\\n\\\\n- A Living, Breathing World\\\\n- Excellent Story\\\\n- Fantastic Gameplay\\\\n- Gorgeous Soundtrack\\\\n- Just Damned Cool\\\\n\\\\n#### CONS\\\\n\\\\n- A few of the English VOs are Weak\", \"question\": \"Will Assassin's Creed Shadows rank 1st on Steam's Weekly Top Sellers chart for March 18 - 25, 2025?\", \"background\": \"Assassin's Creed Shadows is an upcoming action role-playing game developed by Ubisoft Quebec, set to release on March 20, 2025, for PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox Series X/S, macOS, and iPadOS.

I was obsessed with finishing the assassination targets and working through the Objective board with many late nights to see it through. The wait for Ubisoft to bring the series to Japan has been worth it, especially given the technical appeal of modern gaming making it even more impressive than I had imagined.

The setting is breathtaking, the variety in the missions is great and the gameplay feels very well thought out. The interaction between Yasuke and Naoe in particular creates an interesting dynamic. While Yasuke excels in combat, Naoe offers probably the best parcours gameplay the series has ever had. Traversal with Yasuke, the actual story and the typical open-world problems do tarnish the whole thing somewhat, but the series certainly wasn't this good for a while.\\\\n\\\\n[-](https://opencritic.com/outlet/563/checkpoint-gaming)\\\\n\\\\n**Checkpoint Gaming**[Edie W-K](https://opencritic.com/critic/6031/edie-w-k)-\\\\n\\\\n[9 / 10](https://checkpointgaming.net/reviews/2025/03/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\\\\n\\\\nAssassin's Creed Shadows is another notch in the belt of this illustrious series. Sneaking and stabbing as Naoe or duelling foes in honourable combat as Yasuke, the duel protagonists are a genius addition to all the things we love about Assassin's Creed. Even though I haven't gelled with the more recent huge open-world AC titles, I leave my time with Assassin's Creed Shadows with renewed excitement for the series thanks to a more manageable map size and a great story.

The contrast between Naoe and Yasuke offers distinct playstyles, encouraging variety and experimentation. Stealth mechanics are more polished than ever, while combat, though not as deep as a pure action game, remains fun and well-balanced.\\\\n\\\\nFeudal Japan is recreated with exceptional detail, thanks to top-tier artistic direction and a solid technical foundation, benefiting from the departure from old consoles. The seasonal cycle isn\\\\u0019t just aesthetic but adds meaningful gameplay dynamics, keeping exploration engaging.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, some concerns remain. The Animus Hub feels more like an unfinished concept than a true revolution, and the modern-day storyline risks becoming secondary again.

Sure, its combat can be clunky and some story beats felt oddly placed (particularly Yasuke's backstory), but Shadows is exactly what Assassin's Creed needed to prove it still has a beating heart. Whether you\\\\u0019re looking to explore the stunning world of feudal Japan, storm the gates of an enemy castle, or fall in love with the many NPCs that populate its world, Assassin's Creed Shadows is an immersive treat that cements itself as the best Assassin's Creed game since Black Flag.\\\\n\\\\n[-](https://opencritic.com/outlet/944/digitale-anime)\\\\n\\\\n**Digitale Anime**[Raouf Belhamra](https://opencritic.com/critic/11073/raouf-belhamra)-\\\\n\\\\n*Arabic*-\\\\n\\\\n[9 / 10](https://ar.digitaleanime.dz/archives/63927)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\\"A worthy heir to a venerable lineage\\\\\\\" Assassin's Creed Shadows offers one of the most distinctive stealth and infiltration experiences in the series, thanks to its dual-hero system and richly detailed world.

Assassin's Creed Shadows makes the most of that theme, with a great pair of shinobi and samurai heroes sharing center stage that are well-written and fun to skulk through giant castles or wade into vicious battles with. Besides the setting, the bulk of the changes this time focus on making smaller tweaks to well-established systems, such as less cluttered maps and skill trees, while also doubling down on things that really worked in 2023\\\\u0019s Assassin\\\\u0019s Creed Mirage, like the more focused and tougher combat that accompanies its better paced main quests. It\\\\u0019s not a perfect reset, as imbalances and missed opportunities abound, but I feel more confident than ever that Assassin\\\\u0019s Creed could be back and here to stay.\\\\n\\\\nLike a river in the rainy season, Shadows\\\\u0019 story overflows with cliches that are signature to fiction set in this era. Warriors wander the land to bring honor to themselves and their masters. Absent rulers let wealthy bureaucrats exploit the poor. Bandits hold the countryside in the cold grip of fear. If you\\\\u0019re a fan of James Clavell\\\\u0019s Shogun or the excellent movies of Akira Kurosawa, you have certainly seen the bulk of what protagonists Yasuke and Naoe are made to navigate. This isn\\\\u0019t a bad thing, and morally complex intersecting plots still keep the intrigue high, which is the same trick that made Assassin\\\\u0019s Creed Valhalla\\\\u0019s stories work when they did. I don\\\\u0019t think I was particularly wowed by the writing on a regular basis, but there are some standout moments of tense reflection and curious happenings sprinkled throughout. The typical Assassin\\\\u0019s Creed conspiracy woven into it fits perfectly within the war torn Sengoku period of Japan, too, like a hidden blade snugly in its wrist sheath.\\\\n\\\\nThe leads themselves are wonderful. You spend a lot of the early game with the sharp-witted and broody Naoe, who is among the last shinobi warriors of the Iga clan, a role thrust upon her by tragedy. That tragedy befell her in part by the hands of the charismatic hulk Yasuke, who is a tireless warrior for justice and peace. When they begin working together, they are frequently each other\\\\u0019s most reliable consul, with sound and often different perspectives on the events going on around them. In other words, they truly do balance one another, and while I don\\\\u0019t think either one would win popularity contests against other series stars like Ezio or Edward, together they serve as the bright light in the center of a largely dark tale of revenge.\\\\n\\\\nThe story overall is paced similarly to Valhalla, where the cardinal reason to be in each of the nine regions of the map is to play through a mostly self-contained chapter. That said, Shadows does a better job of making sure at least some story elements and characters don\\\\u0019t just completely vanish when you leave a region the way they did in its predecessor. Not every new lord or business man you meet becomes completely irrelevant after you\\\\u0019ve solved their problems. I also found these sections, and the overall time it took to move from chapter to chapter, to be more brisk and less filled with frustrating filler than past games. It\\\\u0019s still a bit too full of \\\\u001cgo here, do that\\\\u001d as bridges between major moments than I\\\\u0019d prefer, but it's organized in a way that can be enjoyed in pieces and at your leisure without getting too lost between plot points, almost like how one might read a good book.\\\\n\\\\nMost of the missions in Shadows start on the objective board, a bigger and more elaborate chart of people that need assistance and targets that need eliminating adapted from Assassin\\\\u0019s Creed Mirage. Thematically, this approach matches the tone of using all the information you gather to identify hidden members of the secret society trying to plunge Japan into chaos. Functionally, the way it organizes outstanding tasks and the people involved is far more useful than the old bulleted quest lists. It does trade some of the magic of exploration away as a cost of this efficacy, though. More than once I organically stumbled across a jerk that couldn\\\\u0019t be talked down, just to kill them and find not only his crossed out profile tacked to my board, but also the exact number of remaining silhouettes of the gang I had no idea they were a part of until right then. But it\\\\u0019s a trade I would make every time.\\\\n\\\\nSelecting a quest gave me a short list of clues to help discern where the objective was, which is easier to figure out depending on how well I\\\\u0019d searched that part of the map already. Past games have given hints to identify targets like this before, hoping to create some friction between you and the effort to find your quarry, but Shadows is the first one that I felt constantly made me look at my map and actually deduce where the spot in question might be by using those clues and some educated guesses. I could use scouts, one of the assets you can develop at your hideout, to assist in the narrowing process, pinging an area on the map and highlighting unidentified objectives in the zone. This doesn't reveal hidden locations or features of the map outside of just a marker though, so it's a bad way to clear fog of war from a distance. It will also cost one scout whether they find something or not, and scouts are replenished in very few ways, so scouting can be a real risk if you\\\\u0019re trying to make progress in the main story \\\\u0013 especially early on.\\\\n\\\\nRather than lighting up your map with a galaxy of tooltips, Shadows mostly relies on sparse point-of-interest icons to push you towards the areas you\\\\u0019ll need to see the finer details of in-person. Even when you climb up to the signature highpoints to take a good long look at your surroundings, what you\\\\u0019ll see is a bevy of nondescript icons that tell you that *something *is out there, but you\\\\u0019re gonna have to hop down from that perch and go check them out for yourself to know what. I love this \\\\u0013 I could feel my brain starting to detangle the checklist conditioning that years of these games had instilled in me. Not only did I feel compelled to just ride through the countryside and genuinely explore stuff without much expectation of grand rewards, I also felt no nagging compulsion to check off every possible thing to do in a region inorganically.\\\\n\\\\nMost of these undiscovered locations fall into one of a number of reliable categories, like castles you can infiltrate and attempt to steal special gear from or any of the many villages scattered across Japan, but you can\\\\u0019t be sure unless you take it in for yourself. A common thing I would always stop to handle whenever I came across them were world activities \\\\u0013 these are smaller locations and events that, when completed, add knowledge points to your characters, increasing their knowledge levels and adding new options to their skill trees. Not all of these events are exciting, with running around temples to find missing scroll pages being my least favorite, but they often don\\\\u0019t take too long and the points are worth it in the end. And in the case of something like the horse archery challenges, they can add an interesting distraction from the action for a short spell.\\\\n\\\\nBetween outings, I spent some time at the hideout, this iteration of Valhalla\\\\u0019s Ravensthorpe settlement. After collecting minerals, crops, and wood out in the world, you can use those resources to build and upgrade important buildings here that give you access to new assets. I spent the majority of my time at the forge managing my equipment, while other important buildings provide more passive additions or have features that can be managed in places outside of the hideout, like the new summoning ability from the dojo which let me call in help from certain allies I met during my adventure. I\\\\u0019m glad I didn\\\\u0019t have to dote on this place very much as I personally can\\\\u0019t be bothered to decorate a homestead, but for those interested in that sort of thing I was absolutely flooded by the cosmetics I unlocked just in the natural course of completing tasks and looting, so you\\\\u0019ll never be starved for options to spice the place up.\\\\n\\\\nThe real sightseeing, though, is out in the world. 1500s Japan is a beautiful place \\\\u0013 there\\\\u0019s such a symphony of color over every hill and across every lake. Each season brings with it incredible landscapes, sometimes covered in the reddish brown of Autumn or entombed in deep white snow. In fact, I found the weather to be some of the best I\\\\u0019d ever experienced in an open world. It was hard not to be moved watching powerful winds pick up and bring in rolling thunderstorms, especially when watching how nature reacted to it all in real time, as flocks of birds took flight and ground critters scurry around to find safety. And not for nothing, but in my dozens of hours in Shadows I encountered remarkably few bugs for a game this size.\\\\n\\\\nThe main 40-hour story revolves around the dual protagonists attempting to unmask and eliminate members of a deadly organization called the Shinbakufu. Once you\\\\u0019ve chosen a target, the multi-mission arcs give you regular opportunities to handle a situation with either Yasuke\\\\u0019s might or Naoe\\\\u0019s stealth. However, while there are certainly scenarios where one is more useful than the other, in general, there are remarkably few quests where Naoe isn\\\\u0019t better suited for the task at hand. This comes down to how their abilities are divided between them. If the classic Assassin\\\\u0019s Creed playstyle is the combination of exploration, parkour, stealth, and combat, Naoe can do all of these competently and excels at parkour and stealth. Yasuke, meanwhile, can\\\\u0019t climb very well or sneak around much due to his size and general lack of grace. He is a devastating force in combat \\\\u0013 maybe the most overbearing and dominant protagonist in the series \\\\u0013 but Naoe can simply sneak around most situations that Yasuke would cut his way through, solving them with so much less trouble if done well. As much as I like Yasuke, he\\\\u0019s far more limited and one dimensional in his style, with large parts of this game not quite designed to take advantage of his strengths in a way that feels intentional.\\\\n\\\\nIt's particularly disappointing because Shadows does find ways to tailor missions around both of their skills on occasion, usually in bigger, more pivotal and important battles where both heroes need to operate together to succeed. These special missions are separated into sections that allow you to choose which character to proceed with, changing what\\\\u0019s asked of you depending on your choice. In a later game mission, Naoe is securing the perimeter of the castle walls, taking out gunmen, while Yasuke storms the place demanding to challenge this chapter\\\\u0019s foe to a duel for the lives of his hostages. Depending on who you play as, you\\\\u0019re either weaving through blockades to drop specific soldiers without alerting the whole castle, or you\\\\u0019re having a fierce duel against a powerful samurai. It's awesome, and made the more homogenous space between these moments a real bummer.\\\\n\\\\nCombat overall is more challenging than in the past. Enemies, especially in groups, are more aggressive, relying on combos and unblockable attacks as often as possible. They also tend to have solid defenses, both in that they block a lot and also in that many of them are armored, essentially giving them a second life bar. Effectively taking them down means having a solid defense of your own, dodging and deflecting their blows to make them vulnerable, and taking advantage before they recover. It requires a more thoughtful execution of your various abilities than previous games have, and I never felt like combat was a chore in and of itself \\\\u0013 though the camera really struggled to keep all of the action in frame, and doubly so when inside buildings.\\\\n\\\\nStraightforward combat really sings when playing as Yasuke, whose set of swords, naginata, kanabo, bows, and even guns are all perfect for decimating enemies. He is a juggernaut of a man outside of his toys, being able to literally run through walls and shake the earth with his blows. He\\\\u0019s also tough and can take many more blows before succumbing to his wounds. Naoe is very fragile by comparison, and while capable of doing lots of damage when enemies are vulnerable, she struggles to stagger them without the help of her tools. She gets overwhelmed easily by mobs, especially well-armored bruisers, and when the numbers get above three or four foes, I almost always found it better to drop a smoke bomb and disappear versus attempting to fight them all in an open melee.\\\\n\\\\nOn the flipside, Naoe is a menace when striking from the shadows or catching enemies unaware. This Assassin\\\\u0019s Creed takes the \\\\u001cShadows\\\\u001d in its name seriously, with darkness being a key part of her stealth gameplan. There are some new features that help her out, like being able to crawl and dodge while prone, as well as some returning ones like her Eagle Sense, which lets you see silhouettes of enemies through walls. The long-missing double assassination is back too, and all of these add up to make Naoe one of the most robust assassins in the series. Yasuke can\\\\u0019t hold a candle to his ninja counterpart in this arena.\\\\n\\\\nEnhancing your combat abilities is mercifully less tedious than Valhalla\\\\u0019s skill constellation. Naoe and Yasuke have skill trees focused on their weapons and specialities, with every node feeling far more impactful than simple passive damage bonuses (which still exist, but in small amounts). Gaining new abilities is obviously the most impactful, but some of the real hidden gems add new functionality to weapons, like being able to turn certain attacks with Naoe\\\\u0019s chain sickle into grapples that let you pull enemies into obstacles or off of cliffs. Yasuke and his abundance of weapons made for some skill trees I largely ignored, especially his bow and teppo, as he is such a close ranged juggernaut that I had a hard time justifying spending my admittedly plentiful skill points on a ranged strategy I never embraced.\\\\n\\\\nSpeaking of excess, Shadows takes a big step backward from the work done around your inventory in Valhalla and Mirage. There are far too many pieces of randomized, color-tiered gear to pick up from fallen foes or as forgettable quest rewards that have no chance of making it into my rotation. Base stats like damage might make them relevant as last-minute stop gaps to keep your stats in line with bad guys at your level, but only until you find that next piece of legendary gear or earn enough resources to level up a piece you already like. The skills on legendary gear, like a kanabo that turns enemies into shrapnel grenades when you break their armor, are impactful in a way that the generic percentage buffs to XYZ skill that you get from the lower tiers of gear never even come close to.\", \"question\": \"Will Assassin's Creed Shadows rank 1st on Steam's Weekly Top Sellers chart for March 18 - 25, 2025?\", \"background\": \"Assassin's Creed Shadows is an upcoming action role-playing game developed by Ubisoft Quebec, set to release on March 20, 2025, for PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox Series X/S, macOS, and iPadOS.

[First reported by Eurogamer](https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-pre-orders-solid-in-line-with-series-second-biggest-launch), Ubisoft claimed in its most recent quarterly earnings call that pre-order sales are currently \\\\\\\"solid\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\n## Assassin's Creed Shadows Pre-Order Sales Are Just As Good As Odyssey's\\\\n\\\\nExact pre-order numbers were never revealed, but Ubisoft gives us an idea as to just how well Assassin's Creed Shadows is performing before launch by claiming the title is \\\\\\\"in line with those of Assassin's Creed Odyssey\\\\\\\", which is the second most successful game in the series.\\\\n\\\\nAssassin's Creed Valhalla is currently the most successful entry in the series, and it sounds as though that title isn't really under threat from Shadows.\\\\n\\\\nOf course, just because a game's pre-order sales are high, doesn't automatically mean it will sell like hotcakes.

      "content": "Based on the gathered evidence, here is an analysis of the likelihood that \"Assassin's Creed Shadows\" will rank 1st on Steam's Weekly Top Sellers chart for March 18 - 25, 2025:\n\n1. **Critical Reception**: \"Assassin's Creed Shadows\" has received positive reviews from multiple sources, with high scores such as 9.5/10 from Analog Stick Gaming and 10/10 from Gfinity. The game is praised for its writing, protagonists, and return to stealth gameplay, which could drive strong sales.\n\n2. **Pre-Order Sales**: Ubisoft reports that pre-orders for \"Assassin's Creed Shadows\" are \"solid\" and in line with those of \"Assassin's Creed Odyssey,\" the second most successful game in the series. This indicates a strong initial interest that could translate into high sales upon release.\n\n3. **Release Timing**: The game is set to release on March 20, 2025, which is within the week of March 18-25, 2025. This timing is crucial as it aligns with the period for the Steam Top Sellers chart.\n\n4. **Market Conditions**: Ubisoft is under pressure to have a successful launch due to recent underperforming titles and company struggles. This could lead to aggressive marketing and promotional efforts to boost sales.\n\n5. **Historical Context**: While high pre-orders are a positive indicator, they do not guarantee top sales rankings, as seen with other games like \"Dragon Age: The Veilguard.\" Additionally, \"Assassin's Creed Valhalla\" remains the most successful game in the series, suggesting that while Shadows may perform well, it might not surpass Valhalla's success.\n\nConsidering these factors, the probability that \"Assassin's Creed Shadows\" will rank 1st on Steam's Weekly Top Sellers chart for the specified week is moderately high, but not certain due to competition and market dynamics.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY: 0.65"
